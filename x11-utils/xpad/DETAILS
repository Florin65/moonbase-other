xpad is a sticky note application written using GTK+ 2.0 that strives to be simple, fault-tolerant, and customizable. xpad consists of independent pad windows; each is basically a text box in which notes can be written. Despite being called xpad, all that is needed to run or compile it is the GTK+ 2.0 libraries.
