xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap. It opens a window that looks like
a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what KeySyms and Modifier bits
that key generates. Clicking on a key simulates KeyPress/KeyRelease events on
the window of your choice. It is possible to change the KeySyms and Modifiers
generated by a key through a mouse-based interface. This program can also write
an input file for xmodmap to recreate your changes in future sessions.
