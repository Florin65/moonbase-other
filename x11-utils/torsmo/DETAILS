Torsmo is a system monitor that sits in the corner of your desktop. 
It's very simple, customizable and it renders only text on the 
desktop (and percentagebars if you want it to ;) and the only lib 
it uses is Xlib.

Torsmo can show various information about your system and it's 
peripherals, including things like the Kernel version, Uptime, 
System time, etc. etc.
