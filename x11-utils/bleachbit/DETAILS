BleachBit quickly frees disk space and tirelessly guards your privacy. Free
cache, delete cookies, clear Internet history, shred temporary files, delete
logs, and discard junk you didn't know was there. It wipes clean a thousand
applications including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash, Google Chrome,
Opera, and more. Beyond simply deleting files, BleachBit includes advanced
features such as shredding files to prevent recovery, wiping free disk space
to hide traces of files deleted by other applications, and vacuuming Firefox
