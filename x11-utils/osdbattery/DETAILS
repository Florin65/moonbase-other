osdbatery is a simple application which shows battery info for laptops.
This program parses ACPI kernel info and shows it in an on-screen display.
It is very useful for notebooks when using full screen applications,
since it allows you to monitor your battery state in all applications.
It shows a status bar, the percentage of battery power left, and maximum,
minimum, and current voltage. It has a configuration file to specify placement
on the desktop, font, color, and update interval.
