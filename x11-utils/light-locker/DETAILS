cat << EOF
light-locker is a simple locker (forked from gnome-screensaver) that aims to
have simple, sane, secure defaults and be well integrated with the desktop
while not carrying any desktop-specific dependencies.
It relies on lightdm for locking and unlocking your session via ConsoleKit/
UPower or logind/systemd.
