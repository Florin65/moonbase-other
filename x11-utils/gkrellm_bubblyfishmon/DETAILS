And, ok, for those who don't know what this is. bubblemon is a system
load application. Its little window will show a little duck swimming on
the water. The water level represents the memory usage of the system,
the number of bubbles in the water represents the cpu load. The color of
water will turn darker when more swap spaces is being used. If you move
your mouse over bubblemon, it will fade out into a system load graph,
damn nice :)
