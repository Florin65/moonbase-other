  The installation is now complete but before you can
  begin to use your new fonts you must configure X
  so that it will use them properly.

  Add the line 'FontPath "/usr/share/fonts/truetype"'
  to the Files section of your /etc/X11/XF86Config
  file and 'dir "/usr/share/fonts/truetype"' to your
  /etc/X11/XftConfig file. If you use the font server
  you must also add a similar line to
  /etc/X11/fs/config. If you are running in X
  already you must restart X or the font server
  before your new fonts will be available.
