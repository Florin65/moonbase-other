Xplanet was inspired by Xearth, which renders an image of the earth into the X root window. Azimuthal, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, or rectangular projections can be shown as well as a window with a globe the user can rotate interactively using OpenGL or Mesa. The other planets and some satellites may also be displayed.
