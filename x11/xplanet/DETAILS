Xplanet was inspired by Xearth, which renders an image of the earth into the 
X root window. Azimuthal, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, or rectangular 
projections can be shown as well as a window with a globe the user can rotate 
interactively using OpenGL or Mesa. The other planets and some satellites may 
also be displayed.
