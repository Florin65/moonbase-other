What is XFree86?
The XFree86 Project, Inc is an organisation which produces XFree86, a
freely redistributable open-source implementation of the X Window System
that runs on UNIX(R) and UNIX-like (like Linux, the BSDs, Mac OS X (aka
Darwin) and Solaris x86 series) operating systems and OS/2.
XFree86 is the underlying software that is between the hardware and
graphical user interface (aka gui) that people see and use. If you are
using KDE, GNOME, Enlightenment, Blackbox, AfterStep, twm or fvwm then
you are already using and running XFree86 as these run as our clients.
Traditionally, The XFree86 Project has focused on Intel x86-based
platforms, which is where the 86 in our name comes from, but our
current release supports other platforms like the Alpha, PowerPC, Sparc
and in-the-works MIPS CPU families.
Our goal at XFree86 is to have X run on every platform available,
including those we do not currently support, as the best windowing
system available on that platform.
