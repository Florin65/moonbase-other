XForms is a GUI toolkit based on Xlib for X Window Systems. It features
a rich set of objects, such as buttons, scrollbars, and menus etc.
integrated into an easy and efficient object/event callback execution
model that allows fast and easy construction of X-applications. In
addition, the library is extensible and new objects can easily be
created and added to the library.
