eRSS is a simple tool for watching RSS v1 (RDF) and v2 (XML) feeds. By
creating simple config files you can definate how each feed is 
monitored, by including a clock, spedifying what information is 
displayed, the feed title, and how often its updated. Feeds can be 
displayed either bordered (a conventional window) or borderless for 
embedding in your desktop. Each feed is its own proccess allowing you 
to start and stop diffrent feeds individually.
