cat << EOF
netconfig is a text-based tool for configuration of ethernet devices.
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and BOOTP (Boot Protocol)
are protocols which allow individual devices on an IP network to get
their own network configuration information (IP address, subnetmask,
broadcast address, etc.) from network servers. The overall purpose of
DHCP and BOOTP is to make it easier to administer a large network. 
Pump is a combined BOOTP and DHCP client daemon, which allows your 
machine to retrieve configuration information from a server. You 
should install this package if you are on a network which uses BOOTP
or DHCP.
