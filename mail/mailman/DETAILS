Mailman is software to help manage electronic mail discussion lists, much like
Majordomo or Smartmail. Mailman gives each mailing list a unique web page and
allows users to subscribe, unsubscribe, and change their account options over
the web. Even the list manager can administer his or her list entirely via the
web. Mailman has most of the features that people want in a mailing list
management system, including built-in archiving, mail-to-news gateways, spam
filters, bounce detection, digest delivery, and so on.
