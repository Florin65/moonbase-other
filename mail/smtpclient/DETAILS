cat << EOF
This program is a minimal SMTP client that takes an email message body and passes it on to a SMTP server (default is the MTA on the local host). Since it is completely self-supporting, it is especially suitable for use in restricted environments.

It is used by me to handle private port email with spamassassin and postfix.

See http://jessen.ch/articles/enidans-spamassassin.shtml for details!
