cat << EOF
This library implements several algorithms related to the Unicode Standard:
- Look up uppercase, lowercase, and titlecase equivalents of a unicode character
- Implementation of grapheme and work breaking rules.
- Implementation of line breaking rules.
- Several ancillary functions, like looking up the unicode character that
  corresponds to some HTML 4.0 entity (such as “&amp;”, for example), and
  determining the normal width or a double-width status of a unicode character.
  Also, an adaptation of the iconv(3) API for this unicode library.
- Look up the Unicode script property.
- Look up the category property.
This library also implements C++ bindings for these algorithms.
