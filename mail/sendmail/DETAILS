Sendmail is the de-facto standard SMTP server for relaying e-mail around
the world. Sendmail is a very complex server that allows great
flexibility but at the cost of complexity. It's installation is
lengthy and configuration can be a nightmare, be warned. Fortunately
it is the most reliable mailserver around so almost any major e-mail
provider runs this.
