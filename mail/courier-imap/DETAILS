Courier-IMAP is a server that provides IMAP access to Maildirs.

The overall design goal of Courier-IMAP is to provide IMAP services to maildirs 
with the least amount of resources. For this reason there are many parameters 
that can be tuned during initial configuration and at runtime. Unwanted 
components can be removed completely, and they will not take up any resources. 
Few sites need the ability to search messages in twenty different character 
sets, so there's no need to waste memory storing large character set mapping 
tables. Sites that need multilingual searching and sorting abilities can 
selectively choose which character set tables will be supported by the server, 
individually. If SSL support is needed, it is available. If not, the SSL 
wrapper does not have to be installed at all. If the server does not have the 
sufficient resources to sort large folders, the server-based IMAP sorting 
function can be turned off.
