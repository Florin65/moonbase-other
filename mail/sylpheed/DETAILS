cat << EOF
Sylpheed is a GTK+ based, lightweight, and fast email client. Almost
all commands are accessible with the keyboard. It also has many
features such as multiple accounts, POP3/APOP support, thread display,
and multipart MIME. One of Sylpheed's future goals is to be fully
internationalized. The messages are managed in the MH format, so you'll
be able to use it together with another mailer that uses the MH format.
