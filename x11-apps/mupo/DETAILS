cat << EOF
MuPO features hierarchical todo-list and notes, appointments, calendar,
and project-time recorder.  Fully searchable. Every item (appointment,
note, todo) can have start and end (due) dates and be recurring.  Reminders
will be in a forthcoming release.  According to the author, this
multi-platform source code has been tested on linux/x86,
linux/mips (Agenda VR3 pda), linux/arm (Compaq iPaq), and Win32.
Uses the FLTK library.
Patched to allow recurring events that have start/stop times.
