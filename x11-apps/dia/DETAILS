Dia is a program for creating diagrams of all kinds. The current version
can do UML class diagrams, Entity-Relationship modeling, network
diagrams, and much more. The engine is very flexible and dynamically
loads diagram-types from disk. It can currently export to PostScript and
load/save in an XML format.
