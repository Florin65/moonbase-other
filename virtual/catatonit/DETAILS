cat << EOF
catatonit has identical usage to other basic docker-init's -- you give it the
command and list of arguments to that command. If catatonit is not pid1, it will
try to use the sub-reaper support in the kernel. You can pass -g if you want
signals to be forwarded to the entire process group of your spawned process
(otherwise it's just forwarded to the process spawned).
