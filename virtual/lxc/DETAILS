cat <<EOF
The container technology is actively being pushed into the mainstream
linux kernel. It provides the resource management through the control
groups aka process containers and resource isolation through the
namespaces.

The linux containers, lxc, aims to use these new functionalities to
provide an userspace container object which provides full resource
isolation and resource control for an application or a system.

The first objective of this project is to make the life easier for the
kernel developers involved in the containers project and especially
to continue working on the Checkpoint/Restart new features. The lxc
is small enough to easily manage a container with simple command
lines and complete enough to be used for other purposes.
