Wine Is Not an Emulator. It is an alternative implementation of the Windows 3.x
and Win32 APIs. Wine provides both a development toolkit (Winelib) for porting
legacy Windows sources to Unix and a program loader, allowing unmodified
Windows 3.1/95/NT binaries to run under Intel Unixes. Wine does not require
Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting
of 100% Microsoft-Free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if
they are available.
