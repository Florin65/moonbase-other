cat << EOF
IPVS (IP Virtual Server) implements transport-layer load balancing
inside the Linux kernel, so called Layer-4 switching. IPVS running
on a host acts as a load balancer before a cluster of real servers,
it can direct requests for TCP/UDP based services to the real servers,
and makes services of the real servers to appear as a virtual service
on a single IP address.
