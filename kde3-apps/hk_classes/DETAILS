cat << EOF
hk_classes is a set of non-visual routines which allow you to develop
database frontend applications as easy as possible.

You need also a database driver to run applications. Drivers for
* Mysql
* PostgreSQL 
* SQLite 
* ODBC

are included in this library and will be automatically installed if 
configure finds a working Mysql/PostgreSQL/SQLite/ODBC installation 
on your computer.
