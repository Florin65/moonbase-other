cat << EOF
LinCVS is a graphical Interface for the cvs client commandline tool on 
the Unix, Windows and Mac OS X platform. It allows to load modules from 
a server (checkout), create modules on the server (import), as well as 
checking the state of directories and individual files or updating them. 
Basic operations like add, remove and commit are supported as matter of 
course, just like showing the actual differences between the server 
version and the local sandbox, graphical display of the version tree, 
and manifoldy graphical support of project maintenance. All actions are 
logged on the cvs server (configurable via history), and are therewith 
comprehensible.
