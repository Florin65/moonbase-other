LinCVS is a graphical Interface for the cvs client commandline tool on the
Unix, Windows and Mac OS X platform. It allows ato load modules from a server
(checkout), create modules on the server (import), as well as checking the
state of directories and individual files or updating them. Basic operations
like add, remove and commit are supported as matter of course, just like
showing the actual differences between the server version and the local
sandbox, graphical display of the version tree, and manifoldy graphical
support of project maintenance. All actions are logged on the cvs server
(configurable via history), and are therewith comprehensible.
