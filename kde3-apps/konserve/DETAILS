        SHORT="Konserve is an incremental backup application for KDE."

cat << EOF
Konserve is a small backup application for the KDE environment. It
lives in the system tray and is able to create backups of several
directories or files periodically.  Konserve uses standard KDE network
transparency to upload your backups to wherever you want. Also it is
possibly to restore a incidently deleted file or directory from a backup
file with just one mouse click.  A nice wizard helps you with the first
steps in using Konserve.
