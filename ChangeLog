	Removing tcl-tk and creating 2 simpler modules: tcl and tk. tk
	depends on tcl, and actually uses the source from tcl for
	compiling. Other than that, tcl compiles without Xfree86 or tk (as
	expected). This will resolve some issues since it was possible to
	install tcl-tk without the tk-libs, and other apps depending on
	those would not be able to resolve that problem. Also all depends
	on tcl-tk were screened and changed either into tcl or tk. Hope you
	followed all of this. /me out. (beer)

	taken out of the build process.  Beware this takes around 4GB of
	disk space to compile, also its going to take a long time depending
	on your CPU speed.
