	We will need a tool to configure our network interfaces. Perhaps someone
	could look at that?
	
	Also... I had to rm -f some things while testing. Some or all of them
	may prove necessary! You will also *HAVE TO* fix your existing
	initscripts to work with this system so we have some work to do before
	this will be usable!
