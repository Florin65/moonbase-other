	* zbeta/sylpheed-gtk2-beta/: BUILD, CONFLICTS, DEPENDS, DETAILS:
	This module is the GTK2 version of sylpheed 0.9.1.  Its quite an
	ungly hack at the moment and you must have gpgme installed to get
	it to work. The autotools are borked if you don't have it
	installed.
	
	If you want to fix it find a way to edit configure.ac to strip out
	the lines defining wether to use gpgme or not if chosen to not
	install with gpgme support. I would have done it myself but I'm a)
	too tired and b) maybe not skilled enough to do it. Feel free to go
	ahead.
	
	hint: If you want a stable (though outdated) GTK2 sylpheed use the
	sylpheed-gtk2 module

	* profiles/netutils-profile/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS, POST_BUILD,
	PRE_BUILD: Adding this module that contains the *basic* networking
	tools required for normal networking operation like ping,
	traceroute, traffic monitoring, ftp, rsync, nmap, iptables, ntp.
	It's also an open invitation to all devs to add other modules in
	here that can be considered part of basic needed networking tools.
	
	Main reason is I keep forgetting to install basic networking stuff
	on new boxes, you know, the tools you only use on occasion but in
	the end quite often. So by making it a profile I only have to
	remember once which things I use and just take a small moment
	installing then (hey, they're all quite small anyway....)
	
	hmm this log message seems way more than adequate.
	
	no wait!
	
	aaargh.
