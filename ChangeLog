	driver is upgraded to 1.0-3123
	
	driver module is now trying to rmmod NVDriver, if fails, notifies SA;
	this is a MUST, because if the old driver (module) is in memory it
	is not possible to restart X w/o first unloading it.
	
	GLX module is hacked and no more /etc/ld.so.preload file entry. Also,
	the previous entry about libgcc_s.so is being removed from the ld.so.preload
	
	The problem is, ld.so.preload is a system-wide preloader and it is not
	possible for some systems to reboot.

	* compilers/gcc/: BUILD, CONFIGURE, POST_INSTALL, PRE_BUILD: Added support for compilation with more languages (lin -r!), and made the BUILD directory through the functions instead of mkdir, so it can be in tmpfs and does not hinder a relin after a broken compile.

	* devel/g-wrap/: BUILD, DETAILS: Fixed the changing search order for system directory problem.  gcc > 3.1
	causes old apps to break, because the old apps insist on adding -I/usr/include
	to CFLAGS, which is an error now if the path is already included previously.
	This is an automake/autoconf/gcc problem.  Its too hard to fix in the automake
	and autoconf files, so its easier to just hack the resulting Makefiles to
	remove the extraneous -I/usr/include string from CFLAGS.  This fix can be
	applied in general to all packages that give the message "changing search order
	for system directory".  Bumped DETAILS date to reflect the addition of the
	BUILD script.
