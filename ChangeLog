	teTeX users need to recompile teTeX-texmf, teTeX, and texinfo (in

	NOT build dialog and texinfo over again.  Building dialog and
	texinfo is very bad as this would also overwrite the Lunar module
	version of dialog and texinfo.	Touched the updated field to FORCE
	a recompile to fix all the misplaced binaries.
