	* x11-utils/xpad/: DETAILS, BUILD: bump version and added opts, it
	  seems it wanted to build static (binreloc) also disabled rpath
	  shouldnt be needed

	* kernel/linux-2.6-prepatch/DETAILS: 2.6.10rc1 -> 2.6.10rc2. gcc
	  3.3.3, glibc 2.3.2, headers 2.6.9.1

	* filesys/e2fsprogs/init.d/mount: yes this was the original fix
	  rev1.2

	* filesys/e2fsprogs/init.d/mount: Ever wonder why your box didn't
	  fsck again on boot? no? well I fixed this a while ago and some
	  people were really happy with it. Until of course the error gets
	  added back in because of the way the init scripts were not being
	  tracked by modules in the past. I hope you are getting the idea
	  now and you should really make sure that the foles you are
	  editing are the right versions. Please please please do.

	* utils/installwatch/BUILD: Make sure installwatch.so is tagged for
	  logging/cache include

2004-11-15 04:29  v3rt1g0

	* audio/beepmp/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Bumping version. This new
	  version is technically a RC, but it has proven to be more stable
	  for most people and it seems that any new beep-media-player only
	  plugins are written for the 0.9.7 api rather than the 0.9.6.	The
	  patch is no longer needed nor is the BUILD file.  Let me know if
	  there are any problems.  Also added a few extra optional depends.

2004-11-15 01:42  v3rt1g0

	* chat/gaim-themes/: DETAILS, PRE_BUILD: Looks like some of the
	  themes went buhbye

2004-11-15 01:29  v3rt1g0

	  profile manager type plugin for Gaim.  Quite robust.

	* kernel/kernel-headers/BUILD: But this is even better in case the
	  tarballs are missing

2004-11-14 22:22  sofar

	  prepare_install here folks...
