	list of the fixes:
	
	Fixed the VideoDVD project. It was not sufficient to use the
	-dvd-video parameter with mkisofs.  K3bProcess now has a clean API
	and a non-stupid implementation which fixes the KDE 3.2 issue way
	better than the hotfix from 0.11.1.  Added read retries and ignore
	read error options to the DVD copy dialog.  Add files to a project
	by dropping them on the corresponding tab.  Removed the query cddb
	option from the copy dialog since this is configured globally
	anyway.  Fixed media detection problems with Plextor DVD writers. 
	Fixed some on-the-fly DVD copy problems.

	* web/amaya/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Version bump to 8.2. 
	Removed the gtk+ optional_depends as this already depends on
	openMotif.  The old DEPENDS file would not correctly build amaya as
	an openMotif app.  Fixed the BUILD script to correctly build this
	as an openMotif app and to use the system libs for jpeg, libpng,
	and zlib.  The Redland (RDF) source code is now included in the
	amaya download but to get that extra lib/app to build from inside
	the amaya BUILD script was not something I wanted to tackle at this
	time.  If there are any Amaya users that need RDF enabled, please
	feel free to fix this module to compile/include those features.

	* video/MPlayer/CONFIGURE: The build of mencoder was breaking the
	compile of MPlayer on my machine with a 2.6.2-rc2 kernel. Since
	most people don't use mencoder, I made it an option that you can
	disable in the configure process.  The new --disable-mencoder

	* perl/perl/POST_INSTALL: Added this because when Perl changes
	versions, the site specific perl modules tend to get lost. 
	Moonbase modules that add their own perl modules to /usr/lib/perl
	need a recompile to ensure proper function.  irssi, ImageMagick,
	SDL_perl are all that I could find at the moment.  I'm sure this
	list will need expanding.
