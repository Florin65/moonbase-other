	* gnome2-core/gnome-audio2/: BUILD, CONFLICTS, DEPENDS, DETAILS: modified the download location and fixed the build script so it installs correctly. Also removed CONFLICTS and DEPENDS because it wont conflict with the gnome-audio module they are installed into 2 diffrent paths, also there is no need to have Gnome-Libs installed for this package it is for Gnome 2 not Gnome 1.4.
