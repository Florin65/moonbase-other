	  CFLAGS in place of the developer defined optimization of -02.
	  Also added a sha1 sum.  Decided to bump the updated date on this

	  nice to have those optimizations.

2004-09-16 00:20  v3rt1g0

	* profiles/docbook-profile/: DEPENDS, DETAILS: Cleaned up the

	  depends in here that were already being filled by other already
	  required depends.

	  The Long Description of this module I think is a bit out of date
	  and blahh,  I don't have enough experience with what this porfile
	  is really attempting to provide to make a description that is
	  really worthwhile.

	  I can't beleive gnome2 actually depends on all this crud :o)
