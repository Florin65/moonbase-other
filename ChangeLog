	* doc-tools/teTeX-texmf/DETAILS: Fixed this module as the WRONG
	source code was being downloaded.  This module requires
	tetex-texmf-2.0.1.tar.gz NOT tetex-texmfsrc-2.0.1.tar.gz.  So all
	teTeX users need to recompile teTeX-texmf, teTeX, and texinfo (in
	that order).

2003-02-26 06:05  tchan

	* doc-tools/teTeX/DETAILS: Fixed the URL for the teTeX homepage.

	into moonbase.	It definitely is required!  This correctly installs
	all the binaries into /usr/bin now, instead of
	/usr/bin/i686-linux-gnu-pc.  The BUILD script also forces teTeX to
	NOT build dialog and texinfo over again.  Building dialog and
	texinfo is very bad as this would also overwrite the Lunar module
	version of dialog and texinfo.	Touched the updated field to FORCE
	a recompile to fix all the misplaced binaries.
