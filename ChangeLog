	  ftp1.mplayer.hu, but Lunar has just cached a copy of that same
	  file and just renamed it to be rp9codecs.tar.bz2.  This is fine

	  depends!

2004-12-17 10:55  jol

	* libs/libavc1394/DEPENDS: - add a dependancy on libraw1394,
	  without this dependancy this module doesn't compile ...

2004-12-17 10:51  jol

	  was inside this module, now i've created a module   for each one.

	  they previously installed for perl-5.8.5.  Yes, CPAN is still a
	  brain dead system when it comes to sharing its dependency
	  information with other tools.  Take it up with the CPAN devs.

	* utils/util-linux/DETAILS: 2.12k -> 2.12l. gcc 3.3.3, glibc 2.3.2,
	  headers 2.6.9.1.  Seems the issue with 2.6 has not been fixed
	  upstream, so the patch is still needed.

2004-12-16 05:31  tchan

	* utils/syslinux/DETAILS: Version bump to syslinux-2.13.
	  Compiled/tested with gcc-3.3.3, glibc-2.3.3, kernel headers

2004-12-16 04:12  v3rt1g0

	* x11-apps/planner/: BUILD, CONFLICTS, DETAILS: Removed the BUILD
	  file as it was just calling default_build.  Removed the CONFLICTS
	  file as the conflicts it listed were not event modules in the
	  moonbase.  Cleaned up the DETAILS a bit.  The EOF had spaces
	  after it which caused 'EOF' to be printed in the 'lvu what'
	  output.

	  Tested with 2.6.x and gcc 3.3.3

	  * Removed the link to /opt/lunar/plugins since the mozilla

	  instead of showing video most of the time

2004-12-15 16:32  moe

	* video/xine-lib/: BUILD, DETAILS: Bumped to rc8

	  * Edited out the modifications at the top of the BUILD file
	  Anyone able to tell me if they are still required?   --> Delete
	  BUILD file if not

	    For me (2.6.x, gcc 3.3.3) xine-lib compiles without errors
	    (Optimization settings aren't really risky though)

	  * xine-ui and gxine are both working while compiled against

	* editors/aspell/BUILD: Never mind.  The extra html docs are
	  already incorporated into the two .info files that are already
	  being installed.  So no need for the html docs and the .info
	  files.

2004-12-15 03:37  tchan

	* editors/aspell/BUILD: Fixed this module to include a LOT of
	  missing documentation.  The html docs are already included in the
	  source tarball, so I installed them.

2004-12-14 22:35  striker

	* x11/XOrg/drivers: Reorder the driver list: * Move generic drivers

	* utils/util-linux/: BUILD, DETAILS: well .. some 2.6 compatibility
	  work. PAGE_SIZE is determined dynamicly in 2.6.x based kernels
	  and therefore the call in fsck.cramfs.c returns nothing since
	  asm/page.h calls a function (which is not included in the
	  util-linux source tree of course).  A mail is out to the
	  maintainer for a request to fix it.

	  /usr/lib/libsoup-2.2.so: undefined reference to
	  'gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file@GNUTLS_REL_1_0_9') so

	  module.

2004-12-02 22:34  v3rt1g0

	* science/celestia-gtk/: BUILD, CONFLICTS, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Inital
	  Import of a GTK/Gnome based varient of the celestia module.  This
	  is handled the same way xscreensaver is handled.  There is a
	  significant build vairiation if you decide to use qt or kde or
	  gtk or gnome or whatever (mainly in the area of depends).  Note
	  this is a newer version then what the celestia module provides.
	  I don't have a stable enough KDE based system ATM to update that
	  one or I would too.
