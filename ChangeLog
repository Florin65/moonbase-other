	* libs/openMotif/: BUILD, DETAILS, include-order.diff: Downgraded

	both work again with this version of openMotif.  Also the source
	code tarball uses "openmotif" and not "openMotif" but I left this
	module name alone, otherwise moonbase would have naming problems
	again (openmotif, openMotif, lesstif).	This version of openMotif
	should also work much better on sparcs and alphas than 2.2.2.

	Removing tcl-tk and creating 2 simpler modules: tcl and tk. tk
	depends on tcl, and actually uses the source from tcl for
	compiling. Other than that, tcl compiles without Xfree86 or tk (as
	expected). This will resolve some issues since it was possible to
	install tcl-tk without the tk-libs, and other apps depending on
	those would not be able to resolve that problem. Also all depends
	on tcl-tk were screened and changed either into tcl or tk. Hope you
	followed all of this. /me out. (beer)
