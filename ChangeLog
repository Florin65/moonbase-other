	* zbeta/sylpheed-gtk2-beta/: BUILD, CONFLICTS, DEPENDS, DETAILS: This module is the GTK2 version of sylpheed 0.9.1.
	Its quite an ungly hack at the moment and you must
	have gpgme installed to get it to work. The autotools
	are borked if you don't have it installed.
	
	If you want to fix it find a way to edit configure.ac
	to strip out the lines defining wether to use gpgme or
	not if chosen to not install with gpgme support. I would
	have done it myself but I'm a) too tired and b) maybe
	not skilled enough to do it. Feel free to go ahead.
	
	hint: If you want a stable (though outdated) GTK2
	sylpheed use the sylpheed-gtk2 module
