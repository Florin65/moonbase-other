	  couldn't stand how broken docbook* was.

	  Everything is now updatable independently, there is nothing left
	  behind in any global configuration file. I also updated a couple
	  of those modules as they really deserved it.

	  Scheme change:

	  docbook-3.1 replaces any docbook-3.x module docbook-sgml replaces
	  any docbook-4.x module

	  iso832943-whatever was deprecated.  The /etc/xml/catalog rebuild
	  is now done by a dynamic file fetched from docbook.org (yeah, I
	  know Nick, you modified it to fit in with Lunar ..  unfortunately
	  you didn't catch up).

	  sgml-common has been sanitized.

	  Tested with gcc 3.3.3, 2.6.x and scrollkeeper, docbook-utils,
	  glade2, gtk-doc and a hell lot of others I probably forgot.
	  Enjoy.

	* mail/sylpheed-claws/: DEPENDS, DETAILS: Version bump to
	  sylpheed-claws-1.0.0. Compiled and tested with gcc-3.3.3,
	  glibc-2.3.3, kernel headers 2.4.x.  NOTES: I had to remove aspell
	  from the DEPENDS file, as the ./configure script fails when
	  compiling an aspell test program.  If aspell is left as an
	  optional depends and the user answers "N" then -claws will still
	  compile, but if they answer "Y" then -claws will fail in the
	  configure step.  If the user has gpgme-1.x installed and they
	  answer "N" to the optional depends on gpgme-0.3.x then -claws
	  will again fail to compile.  Its safest to just answer "Y" to
	  gpgme-0.3.x.
