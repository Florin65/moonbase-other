	box....

2004-06-16 09:35  moe

	* web/firefox/: BUILD, DETAILS, POST_INSTALL, POST_REMOVE: Vital
	update to this module before announcing the update.  Switching back
	to mozilla.org (Tarball is working now), couple of ./configure
	tweaks and POST_INSTALL updates (plugins should go to the right
	place now). Also remove the firefox's remains after lrm.  FIXME:
	Firefox needs to be started as root for the first time since it
	needs to create some garbage in /usr/lib/firefox-0.9.  Thunderbird
	(even the latest one) doesn't dothis (rediculous) behaviour and
	Firefox 0.8 didn't do that either.

2004-06-16 09:24  moe

	bugfix release.

2004-06-16 05:30  tchan

	* utils/edict/BUILD: Someone obviously forgot to test this module
	and removed the BUILD script.  The BUILD script contains a
	"default_make" which is REQUIRED as there is no configure script in
	the source tarball and if BUILD is removed, then lunar runs
	default_build which invokes ./configure (NOT a good thing in this
	module).  Tested with gcc-3.3.3, glibc-2.3.2, kernel-headers 2.4.x.

	* web/firefox/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS, POST_INSTALL, POST_REMOVE:
	Complete rework of this module. Also prepared our own tarball since
	the one from the mozilla ftp is broken (No chrome, browser or
	toolkit directories).  Switching to cairo for svg rendering (works
	good) since libart_lgpl doesn't seem to work for this fox. Did some
	tweaks on the BUILD file and simplified POST_INSTALL and
	POST_REMOVE.  Last but not least: Moved firefox out of /opt and
	into /usr
