	  optional depends and the user answers "N" then -claws will still
	  compile, but if they answer "Y" then -claws will fail in the
	  configure step.  If the user has gpgme-1.x installed and they
	  answer "N" to the optional depends on gpgme-0.3.x then -claws
	  will again fail to compile.  Its safest to just answer "Y" to
	  gpgme-0.3.x.

	* compilers/fasm/DETAILS: Fixed the stupid fasm dev's source
	  tarball for fasm-1.56.  They have updated their source tarball
	  WITHOUT modifying the version number AND their tarball is
	  incorrectly packed (it gunzips with errors/garbage).	So I've
	  temporarily moved a corrected tarball to /lunar/mirrors/.  Once
	  the fasm devs learn how to create proper tar.gz files we can
	  point the download back to their main site.  If some other than
	  tchan fixes this module, make SURE that the tarball from the main
	  dev's site correctly unpacks!!!

	  the BUILD file fixes that.  Also removed the required depends on
	  Python as it is really optional.
