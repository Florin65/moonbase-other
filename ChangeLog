	* security/snort/: BUILD, DETAILS, POST_INSTALL, snort.sysconfig,

	Ok updating snort to new version 2.0.0, now I fixed the module so
	that it will install the rule sets to /etc/snort and the config
	files to /etc, also being that all that was done in the
	POST_INSTALL file nothing got installed.  Now its all done in the
	BUILD file.  I removed the POST_INSTALL file and moved the
	snort.sysconfig file to the config.d directory.  Oh also it wasnt
	installing the snort.sysconfig file for some reason but now it is. 
	It works fine for me now and works out of the box with no
	configuring.  Though I would suggest writing your own snort.conf
	file.

	* libs/glib/: BUILD, DETAILS: Lots of gtk+ apps still break due to
	the upgrade of gettext. Analogous to glib-2 including -lintl (which
	fixes all gtk+-2 apps that break due to the gettext upgrade),
	having glib adding -lintl to glib-config fixes pretty much all the
	gtk+ apps that do not include -lintl somehow. This fix is the
	nicest one I could come up with, and should not interfere with
	stuff.
	
	Note that non-glib-[1|2] apps breaking on gettext don't see this
	fix (hence the wget patch before).
