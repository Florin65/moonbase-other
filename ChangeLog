	driver is upgraded to 1.0-3123
	
	driver module is now trying to rmmod NVDriver, if fails, notifies
	SA; this is a MUST, because if the old driver (module) is in memory
	it is not possible to restart X w/o first unloading it.
	
	GLX module is hacked and no more /etc/ld.so.preload file entry.
	Also, the previous entry about libgcc_s.so is being removed from
	the ld.so.preload
	
	The problem is, ld.so.preload is a system-wide preloader and it is
	not possible for some systems to reboot.

2002-09-11 18:21  tchan

	* devel/g-wrap/: BUILD, DETAILS: Fixed the changing search order
	for system directory problem.  gcc > 3.1 causes old apps to break,
	because the old apps insist on adding -I/usr/include to CFLAGS,
	which is an error now if the path is already included previously. 
	This is an automake/autoconf/gcc problem.  Its too hard to fix in
	the automake and autoconf files, so its easier to just hack the
	resulting Makefiles to remove the extraneous -I/usr/include string
	from CFLAGS.  This fix can be applied in general to all packages
	that give the message "changing search order for system directory".
	 Bumped DETAILS date to reflect the addition of the BUILD script.
