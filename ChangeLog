	* zbeta/sylpheed-gtk2-beta/: BUILD, CONFLICTS, DEPENDS, DETAILS:
	This module is the GTK2 version of sylpheed 0.9.1.  Its quite an
	ungly hack at the moment and you must have gpgme installed to get
	it to work. The autotools are borked if you don't have it
	installed.
	
	If you want to fix it find a way to edit configure.ac to strip out
	the lines defining wether to use gpgme or not if chosen to not
	install with gpgme support. I would have done it myself but I'm a)
	too tired and b) maybe not skilled enough to do it. Feel free to go
	ahead.
	
	hint: If you want a stable (though outdated) GTK2 sylpheed use the
	sylpheed-gtk2 module
