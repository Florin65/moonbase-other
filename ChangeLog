	* security/aide/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Version bump to 0.10. 
	aide has now moved to sourceforge.  BIG module changes to get this
	to compile.  postgresql and libgcrypt are no longer
	optional_depends due to the aide devs borking their configure
	script.  Instead postgresql and libgcrypt MUST be installed,
	otherwise their configure script will die a horrible death.  Once
	those two apps/libs are installed then the aide configure script
	will merrily compile away, but since those two apps/libs need to be
	installed now, I just forced them on in the configure step.  Also
	mhash needs to be recompiled to get the static lib build in
	addition to the shared libs.  I updated the mhash module to reflect
	that fact!

2003-12-09 03:33  tchan

	* crypto/mhash/: BUILD, DETAILS: Added a BUILD script as mhash MUST
	build the static as well as the default shared libs, now.  The aide

	recompile.

	of the different versions has changed on sourceforge for this

	again compiled with no problems.

2003-12-06 03:43  tchan

	* ftp/wu-ftpd/: BUILD, DETAILS: Fixed wu-ftpd to compile again. 
	The wu-ftpd devs have a corrupted file named src/ftpcmd.y (a bison

	Fixed wvstreams to use the latest available release 3.74.0.  Added
	a DEPENDS file just full of optional_depends (hey it's a LIBRARY
	and there is no getting around all choices!)
	
	Made db a required DEPENDS (the devs have it listed as optional) as
	wvstreams-3.74.0 will NOT compile at all unless Berkely DB is
	present and I even had to hack their vars.mk file as their
	configure script is borked and does not correctly detect that
	Berkely DB3 is present and working on a Lunar box.
	
	Compiled and tested with gcc-3.2.3, glibc-2.3.2.

	* x11/xfree86/BUILD: Added the "rm /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a" to the

2003-12-04 07:33  niki

	new version when i release the new linux-grsec.

2003-12-03 20:24  florin

	* libs/glibc/BUILD.sparc64: Taking advantage of elaine's new code
	in theedge to have architecture specific lunar scripts.  This
	simplifies the BUILD script considerably for glibc.  Especially

	symlinks to get glibc to build correctly.

2003-12-02 22:09  tchan

	* shells/busybox/DETAILS: Modified the busybox patch to remove the
	insmod capabilites.  insmod in busybox is not supported on

	and ppc arch's.  I doubt anyone really uses insmod from busybox so
	there is no need to make multiple versions of busybox.	This
	version correctly works on multiple architectures with this simple
	fix.

2003-12-02 03:40  tchan

	* utils/discover/: BUILD, DEPENDS: Modified this to include the new
	"check" module from moonbase/devel/check.  Highly suggested by the
	devs of the discover module and I decided to make it a required
	depends instead of optional.  It makes the BUILD much easier to
	code.

2003-12-02 03:38  tchan

	* devel/check/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Added the check module for
	a unit test framework.	This is recommended by the devs of the

2003-11-25 18:33  tchan

	* libs/openMotif/: BUILD, DETAILS, include-order.diff: Downgraded
	this module back to 2.1.30.  2.2.2 is known to be a broken toolkit.
	 See the URLs in the DETAILS file for more info. Compiled and
	tested this module with gcc-3.2.3, glibc-2.3.2.  nedit and xpdf
	both work again with this version of openMotif.  Also the source
	code tarball uses "openmotif" and not "openMotif" but I left this
	module name alone, otherwise moonbase would have naming problems
	again (openmotif, openMotif, lesstif).	This version of openMotif
	should also work much better on sparcs and alphas than 2.2.2.

2003-11-25 18:29  tchan

	* editors/nedit/DEPENDS: Reverting this module back to openMotif. 
	Avoid lesstif in all modules if possible.  I've fixed openMotif to

	2.2.2.

	naming for the boot images aswell).  Grub always-asking bug has
	been fixed.
