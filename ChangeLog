	  docbook-xsl/POST_REMOVE, openjade/BUILD, openjade/POST_INSTALL,
	  openjade/PRE_REMOVE, scrollkeeper/BUILD, scrollkeeper/DEPENDS:
	  Well, what can I say. I've been working on this for 10 hours
	  straight (Yes, ten hours). I just couldn't stand how broken
	  docbook* was.

	  Everything is now updatable independently, there is nothing left
	  behind in any global configuration file. I also updated a couple
	  of those modules as they really deserved it.

	  Scheme change:

	  docbook-3.1 replaces any docbook-3.x module docbook-sgml replaces
	  any docbook-4.x module

	  iso832943-whatever was deprecated.  The /etc/xml/catalog rebuild
	  is now done by a dynamic file fetched from docbook.org (yeah, I
	  know Nick, you modified it to fit in with Lunar ..  unfortunately
	  you didn't catch up).

	  sgml-common has been sanitized.

	  Tested with gcc 3.3.3, 2.6.x and scrollkeeper, docbook-utils,
	  glade2, gtk-doc and a hell lot of others I probably forgot.
	  Enjoy.

	  Oh and .. bow before your god.  (j/k)

	  PS: Thanks to the folks at BLFS .. without them I would have been
	  clueless (occasionally)
