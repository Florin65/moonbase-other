	release and the dialog ftp site no longer has the 20031008 source
	code available.  Compiled and tested with gcc-3.2.3, glibc-2.3.2.

2003-12-09 14:49  niki

	* devel/cvs/DETAILS: Security update (Only relevant for pservers),

2003-12-09 05:42  tchan

	* security/aide/: BUILD, DEPENDS: Thanks to elaine for pointing out
	how to get aide to compile with installing postgresql and
	libgcrypt.  Returned them to their optional_depends state, rather
	than forcing them to be installed.

2003-12-09 03:56  tchan

	* security/aide/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Version bump to 0.10. 
	aide has now moved to sourceforge.  BIG module changes to get this
	to compile.  postgresql and libgcrypt are no longer
	optional_depends due to the aide devs borking their configure
	script.  Instead postgresql and libgcrypt MUST be installed,
	otherwise their configure script will die a horrible death.  Once
	those two apps/libs are installed then the aide configure script
	will merrily compile away, but since those two apps/libs need to be
	installed now, I just forced them on in the configure step.  Also
	mhash needs to be recompiled to get the static lib build in
	addition to the shared libs.  I updated the mhash module to reflect
	that fact!

2003-12-09 03:33  tchan

	* crypto/mhash/: BUILD, DETAILS: Added a BUILD script as mhash MUST
	build the static as well as the default shared libs, now.  The aide
	module (>= 0.10) REQUIRES the static version of mhash.	Touched the
	UPDATED field in DETAILS to try and force everyone using mhash to
	recompile.

2003-12-09 02:57  nhudson

	Made db a required DEPENDS (the devs have it listed as optional) as
	wvstreams-3.74.0 will NOT compile at all unless Berkely DB is
	present and I even had to hack their vars.mk file as their
	configure script is borked and does not correctly detect that
	Berkely DB3 is present and working on a Lunar box.
	
	Compiled and tested with gcc-3.2.3, glibc-2.3.2.

	* libs/glibc/BUILD.sparc64: Taking advantage of elaine's new code
	in theedge to have architecture specific lunar scripts.  This
	simplifies the BUILD script considerably for glibc.  Especially
	since the sparc64 glibc has to mess around with the /usr/src/linux
	symlinks to get glibc to build correctly.

2003-12-02 22:09  tchan

	* shells/busybox/DETAILS: Modified the busybox patch to remove the
	insmod capabilites.  insmod in busybox is not supported on
	architectures other than x86.  So this fix is for sparc and alpha
	and ppc arch's.  I doubt anyone really uses insmod from busybox so
	there is no need to make multiple versions of busybox.	This
	version correctly works on multiple architectures with this simple
	fix.

2003-12-02 18:24  tchan

2003-12-02 03:40  tchan

	* utils/discover/: BUILD, DEPENDS: Modified this to include the new
	"check" module from moonbase/devel/check.  Highly suggested by the
	devs of the discover module and I decided to make it a required
	depends instead of optional.  It makes the BUILD much easier to
	code.

2003-12-02 03:38  tchan

	* devel/check/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Added the check module for
	a unit test framework.	This is recommended by the devs of the

2003-12-02 02:49  tchan

	* utils/discover/DEPENDS: Added two required depends, curl and
	expat.

	module name alone, otherwise moonbase would have naming problems
	again (openmotif, openMotif, lesstif).	This version of openMotif
