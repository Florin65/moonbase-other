	* graphics/openvrml/: CONFIGURE, DEPENDS: reusing tchan's great
	work from db4 i think that's the proper fix for j2sdk install
	problem.

2003-12-28 08:53  tchan

	* devel/db4/: CONFIGURE, DETAILS: I had to revert db4 back down to
	4.1.25.  4.2.52 will not work correctly with --enable-java and
	blackdown j2sdk.  It errors out during ./configure with:
	
	checking if java works... configure: error: The Java VM java failed
	(see config.log, check the CLASSPATH?)
	
	So if anyone bumps db4 back above 4.1.25, they have to fix the java
	problem first!
	
	I've fixed the Lunar CONFIGURE script to correctly pass the
	--enable-java flag in the $OPTS var.  $OPTS if set in CONFIGURE,
	MUST be echoed out to $MODULE_CONFIG, otherwise the lunar core will
	just unset the OPTS var in satisfy_depends (depends.lunar).
	
	db4 4.1.25 correctly compiles with java enabled and tested with
	gcc-3.2.3, glibc-2.3.2.

	* audio/mpg123/BUILD.alpha: Turns out that since mpg123 doesn't
	have a configure script, we have to specify the target cpu type on
	the "make" command line.  so instead of doing a "make linux" and
	then a "make install", we do a "make linux-alpha" and then the
	install.

	* devel/automake/: BUILD, DETAILS: I'm reverting automake back to
	1.7.9 as 1.8.0 breaks some older moonbase modules, the most
	important of which is the "shadow" module.  Don't mess around with
	automake and shadow unless you can get both modules to work
	correctly together.  automake-1.8.0 is a significant change from
	1.7.x!!!

2003-12-22 01:21  tchan

	* security/shadow/BUILD: Reverted back to previous "touch *"
	command.  Florin's "fix" is incorrect as "touch -r configure.in *"
	just hides the changes to aclocal.m4.  I also reverted automake
	back to 1.79 as the 1.80 version is what really causes the shadow
	module to break during compile.  So don't touch the shadow and
	automake modules unless you can correctly fix the older modules in
	moonbase that break because of all the changes in automake-1.8!!!!!

	* security/aide/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Version bump to 0.10. 
	aide has now moved to sourceforge.  BIG module changes to get this
	to compile.  postgresql and libgcrypt are no longer
	optional_depends due to the aide devs borking their configure
	script.  Instead postgresql and libgcrypt MUST be installed,
	otherwise their configure script will die a horrible death.  Once
	those two apps/libs are installed then the aide configure script
	will merrily compile away, but since those two apps/libs need to be
	installed now, I just forced them on in the configure step.  Also
	mhash needs to be recompiled to get the static lib build in
	addition to the shared libs.  I updated the mhash module to reflect
	that fact!

2003-12-09 03:33  tchan

	* crypto/mhash/: BUILD, DETAILS: Added a BUILD script as mhash MUST
	build the static as well as the default shared libs, now.  The aide

	UPDATED field in DETAILS to try and force everyone using mhash to
	recompile.

	Made db a required DEPENDS (the devs have it listed as optional) as
	wvstreams-3.74.0 will NOT compile at all unless Berkely DB is
	present and I even had to hack their vars.mk file as their
	configure script is borked and does not correctly detect that
	Berkely DB3 is present and working on a Lunar box.
	
	Compiled and tested with gcc-3.2.3, glibc-2.3.2.

	* libs/glibc/BUILD.sparc64: Taking advantage of elaine's new code
	in theedge to have architecture specific lunar scripts.  This
	simplifies the BUILD script considerably for glibc.  Especially

	there is no need to make multiple versions of busybox.	This
	version correctly works on multiple architectures with this simple
	fix.

	code.

2003-12-02 03:38  tchan

	* devel/check/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Added the check module for
	a unit test framework.	This is recommended by the devs of the
