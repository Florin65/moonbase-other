	sed authors fix "sed -i", specifically the code they use in

	sedit in lunar core does NOT set permissions correctly because "sed
	-i" is broken.	This is NOT a lunar problem and is clearly a SED
	problem.

	to mozilla.org (Tarball is working now), couple of ./configure
	tweaks and POST_INSTALL updates (plugins should go to the right
	place now). Also remove the firefox's remains after lrm.  FIXME:
	Firefox needs to be started as root for the first time since it
	needs to create some garbage in /usr/lib/firefox-0.9.  Thunderbird
	(even the latest one) doesn't dothis (rediculous) behaviour and
	Firefox 0.8 didn't do that either.

	* utils/edict/BUILD: Someone obviously forgot to test this module
	and removed the BUILD script.  The BUILD script contains a
	"default_make" which is REQUIRED as there is no configure script in
	the source tarball and if BUILD is removed, then lunar runs
	default_build which invokes ./configure (NOT a good thing in this
	module).  Tested with gcc-3.3.3, glibc-2.3.2, kernel-headers 2.4.x.
