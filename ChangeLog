	problem.

2003-12-28 08:53  tchan

	* devel/db4/: CONFIGURE, DETAILS: I had to revert db4 back down to
	4.1.25.  4.2.52 will not work correctly with --enable-java and
	blackdown j2sdk.  It errors out during ./configure with:
	
	checking if java works... configure: error: The Java VM java failed
	(see config.log, check the CLASSPATH?)
	
	So if anyone bumps db4 back above 4.1.25, they have to fix the java
	problem first!
	
	I've fixed the Lunar CONFIGURE script to correctly pass the
	--enable-java flag in the $OPTS var.  $OPTS if set in CONFIGURE,
	MUST be echoed out to $MODULE_CONFIG, otherwise the lunar core will
	just unset the OPTS var in satisfy_depends (depends.lunar).
	
	db4 4.1.25 correctly compiles with java enabled and tested with
	gcc-3.2.3, glibc-2.3.2.

	* security/shadow/BUILD: Reverted the BUILD script a little too
	far!  It does need the suffix removed in the cracklib dict path.

2003-12-22 01:23  tchan

	* devel/automake/: BUILD, DETAILS: I'm reverting automake back to
	1.7.9 as 1.8.0 breaks some older moonbase modules, the most
	important of which is the "shadow" module.  Don't mess around with
	automake and shadow unless you can get both modules to work
	correctly together.  automake-1.8.0 is a significant change from
	1.7.x!!!

2003-12-22 01:21  tchan

	* security/shadow/BUILD: Reverted back to previous "touch *"
	command.  Florin's "fix" is incorrect as "touch -r configure.in *"
	just hides the changes to aclocal.m4.  I also reverted automake
	back to 1.79 as the 1.80 version is what really causes the shadow
	module to break during compile.  So don't touch the shadow and
	automake modules unless you can correctly fix the older modules in
	moonbase that break because of all the changes in automake-1.8!!!!!

2003-12-21 23:39  tchan

	* filemanagers/mc/DEPENDS: Added some depends.	e2fsprogs is
	actually a required depends since the lunar module is using
	--with-libext2fs flag.	mc by default uses the included mcslang,
	but this is just a stripped version of slang, so might as well use
	the real thing.
