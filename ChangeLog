	* profiles/netutils-profile/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS, POST_BUILD,
	PRE_BUILD: Adding this module that contains the *basic* networking tools required for normal networking operation like ping, traceroute, traffic monitoring, ftp, rsync, nmap, iptables, ntp. It's also an open invitation to all devs to add other modules in here that can be considered part of basic needed networking tools.
	
	Main reason is I keep forgetting to install basic networking stuff on new boxes, you know, the tools you only use on occasion but in the end quite often. So by making it a profile I only have to remember once which things I use and just take a small moment installing then (hey, they're all quite small anyway....)
	
	hmm this log message seems way more than adequate.
	
	no wait!
	
	aaargh.
