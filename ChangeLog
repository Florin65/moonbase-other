	* profiles/netutils-profile/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS, POST_BUILD,
	PRE_BUILD: Adding this module that contains the *basic* networking
	tools required for normal networking operation like ping,
	traceroute, traffic monitoring, ftp, rsync, nmap, iptables, ntp.
	It's also an open invitation to all devs to add other modules in
	here that can be considered part of basic needed networking tools.
	
	Main reason is I keep forgetting to install basic networking stuff
	on new boxes, you know, the tools you only use on occasion but in
	the end quite often. So by making it a profile I only have to
	remember once which things I use and just take a small moment
	installing then (hey, they're all quite small anyway....)
	
	hmm this log message seems way more than adequate.
	
	no wait!
