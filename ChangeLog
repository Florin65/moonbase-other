	* graphics/openvrml/: CONFIGURE, DEPENDS: reusing tchan's great
	work from db4 i think that's the proper fix for j2sdk install
	problem.

2003-12-28 08:53  tchan

	* devel/db4/: CONFIGURE, DETAILS: I had to revert db4 back down to
	4.1.25.  4.2.52 will not work correctly with --enable-java and
	blackdown j2sdk.  It errors out during ./configure with:
	
	checking if java works... configure: error: The Java VM java failed
	(see config.log, check the CLASSPATH?)
	
	So if anyone bumps db4 back above 4.1.25, they have to fix the java
	problem first!
	
	I've fixed the Lunar CONFIGURE script to correctly pass the
	--enable-java flag in the $OPTS var.  $OPTS if set in CONFIGURE,
	MUST be echoed out to $MODULE_CONFIG, otherwise the lunar core will
	just unset the OPTS var in satisfy_depends (depends.lunar).
	
	db4 4.1.25 correctly compiles with java enabled and tested with
	gcc-3.2.3, glibc-2.3.2.

	* audio/mpg123/BUILD.alpha: Turns out that since mpg123 doesn't

	then a "make install", we do a "make linux-alpha" and then the
	install.
