Groovy...
Builds upon the strengths of Java but has additional power features
inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk. Makes modern
programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero
learning curve. Increases developer productivity by reducing
scaffolding code when developing web, GUI, database or console
applications.
