Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual
Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a general-purpose
language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a
scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for
multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles
directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature
supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to
the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure
that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy
and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming
language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.
When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory
system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded
designs.
