cat <<EOF
Kotlin is a multiplatform project allows you to build multiple tiers of your
application – backend, frontend and Android app – from the same codebase.
Such a project contains both common modules, which contain platform-independent
code, as well as platform-specific modules, which contain code for a specific
platform (JVM or JS) and can use platform-specific libraries.
To call platform-specific code from a common module, you can specify expected
declarations – declarations for which all platform-specific modules need to
provide actual implementations.
