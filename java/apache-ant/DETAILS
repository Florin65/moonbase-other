cat << EOF
Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like Make, without
Make's wrinkles and with the full portability of pure Java code.
Used in building many java based apps. Like jedit, tomcat, etc.
Ant is different. Instead of a model where it is extended with shell based
commands, it is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing shell commands,
the configuration files are XML based calling out a target tree where various
tasks get executed. Each task is run by an object which implements a particular
Task interface.
