Kpmenu is a tool written in Go used to view a KeePass database via a dmenu, or
rofi, menu. Features
 - Supports KDBX v3.1 and v4.0 (based on gokeepasslib)
 - Pretty fast database decode thanks to Go
 - Interfaced with dmenu or rofi
 - Customize dmenu/rofi with additional command arguments
 - Kpmenu can be started as a daemon, so you don't need to re-insert credentials
 - By default the first instance of kpmenu will enter in daemon mode (cache
   option) for 60 seconds
 - You can start a permanent daemon with --daemon option (it won't ask open the
   database)
 - Even if the cache times out, the daemon won't be killed
 - Automatically put selected value into the clipboard (for a custom time)
 - xsel and wl-clipboard supported
 - By default it will use xsel, you can override it via config or
   --clipboardTool option
 - Hidden password typing.
