           SHORT="A minimalistic automatic tiling window manager"

cat << EOF
spectrwm is a small dynamic tiling and reparenting window manager for X11.
It tries to stay out of the way so that valuable screen real estate can be used
for much more important stuff. It has sane defaults and does not require one to
learn a language to do any configuration. It is written by hackers for hackers
and it strives to be small, compact and fast.
