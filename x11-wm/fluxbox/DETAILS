Fluxbox is yet another windowmanager!

It is based on the Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like blackbox
and handles styles, colors, window placement and similar thing exactly
like blackbox. 

FEATURES:
Here are the major features of fluxbox:
* Our custom keygrabber (support for emacs-styled kkeychains)
* Iconbar (the toolbar shows minimized windows, one click and they pop back up)
* Configurable titlebar (placement of buttons, new buttons etc)
* Window tabs (see this page for more info and screenshot)
In addition to all this many small fixes and minor features have been added
