cat << EOF
Blackbox is yet another addition to the list of window managers for X.
It is written in C++, sharing no common code with any other window
manager (even though the graphics implementation is similar to that of
WindowMaker). It features small code size, a fast interface with simple
menus, multiple workspaces, and decorated windows , built-in graphics
code to render solids, gradients and bevels on the fly when needed, and
more.
