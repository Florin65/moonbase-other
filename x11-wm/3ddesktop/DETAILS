           SHORT="3ddeskop is for switching virtual desktops"
cat << EOF
3ddestkop is an OpenGL program for switching virtual desktops 
in a seamless 3-dimensional manner.

To setup:
   Run the daemon:
        /usr/bin/3ddeskd --acquire
     The --acquire will cycle to all your virtual desktops
     and grab an image for displaying. *Don't be alarmed!*

   Bind a key to the client:
        /usr/bin/3ddesk

   Pressing key binding (running 3ddesk) activates


Add a global keybinding ("shortcut") via the window manager to run
/usr/bin/3ddesk.  Something like C-M-s (Control-Meta/Alt-s) or
whatever won't conflict with anything else.  When you press this key
combination 3ddesk signals 3ddeskd to start up and it zooms out to
show you the "3d visualization" of your desktop.  Then you select the
screen you want to switch to by pressing ENTER.
