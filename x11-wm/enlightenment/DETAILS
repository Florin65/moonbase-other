cat << EOF
Enlightenment is a themeable, fast, flexible, and powerful window
manager that is designed to be as configurable as possible in both look
and feel. In addition, Enlightenment provides an applet API that
provides functionality somewhere between the GNOME applet system and
Dock Apps from Afterstep/WindowMaker. The current design aim is for
Enlightenment to become a desktop shell.
