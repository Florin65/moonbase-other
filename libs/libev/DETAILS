cat <<EOF
High-performance (see benchmark) event loop that is loosely modelled
after libevent, but without its limitations and bugs. It is used in
GNU Virtual Private Ethernet, rxvt-unicode, auditd, the Deliantra
MORPG Server and Client, and many other programs.
 Features include child/pid watchers, periodic timers
 based on wallclock (absolute) time (in addition to timers
 using relative timeouts), as well as epoll/kqueue/event
 ports/inotify/eventfd/signalfd support, fast timer management,
 time jump detection and correction, and ease-of-use.

It can be used as a libevent replacement using its emulation API or
directly embedded into your programs without the need for complex
configuration support. A full-featured and well-documented perl
interface is also available.
