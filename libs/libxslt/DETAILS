cat << EOF
Libxslt is a C library for GNOME which allows developers to work with
XSLT. It is based on libxml for XML parsing, tree manipulation, and
XPath support. It is written in plain C, making as few assumptions as
possible, and sticking closely to ANSI C/POSIX for easy embedding.
Though not designed primarily with performances in mind, libxslt seems
to be a relatively fast processor.
