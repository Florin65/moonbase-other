SHORT="RoadRunner is a full-featured, robust implementation of the BEEP protocol written in C."

# Long Description
cat << EOF
RoadRunner is a complete application toolkit library implementing the BEEP (Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol) for use in developing network applications. 


BEEP is a connection based protocol, where a single BEEP connection can contain multiple channels in which messages are transmitted. Messages on different channels are transmitted independently of each other. 


Apart from a core BEEP framework, RoadRunner also consists of a useful set of profiles, readily available and usable in applications.
