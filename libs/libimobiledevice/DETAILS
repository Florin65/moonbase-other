libimobiledevice is a software library that talks the protocols to support iPhone,
iPod Touch, iPad and Apple TV devices. Unlike other projects, it does not depend 
on using any existing proprietary libraries and does not require jailbreaking. 
It allows other software to easily access the device's filesystem, retrieve 
information about the device and it's internals, backup/restore the device, 
manage SpringBoard icons, manage installed applications, retrieve 
addressbook/calendars/notes and bookmarks and (using libgpod) synchronize 
music and video to the device.
