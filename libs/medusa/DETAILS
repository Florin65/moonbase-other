cat << EOF
Medusa is a 'server platform' -- it provides a framework for
implementing asynchronous socket-based servers (TCP/IP and on Unix,
Unix domain, sockets).
Medusa includes HTTP, FTP, and 'monitor' (remote python interpreter)
servers.  Medusa can simultaneously support several instances of
either the same or different server types - for example you could
start up two HTTP servers, an FTP server, and a monitor server.  Then
you could connect to the monitor server to control and manipulate
medusa while it is running.
