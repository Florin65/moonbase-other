Eet is primarily a data encoding, decoding and storage library. It is meant to be very programmer 
friendly, removing lots of work from loading and saving data held in data structures. It can store 
multiple chunks of data in a single file and random-access retrieve the data very efficiently, 
encode and decode image data and any other kind of data.
