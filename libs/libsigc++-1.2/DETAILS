cat << EOF
Libsigc++ implements a full callback system for use in widget libraries,
abstract interfaces, and general programming. Originally part of the
Gtk-- widget set, libsigc++ is now a seperate library to provide for
more general use. It is the most complete library of its kind with the
ablity to connect an abstract callback to a class method, function,
or function object. It contains adaptor classes for connection of
dissimilar callbacks and has an ease of use unmatched by other C++
callback libraries. Libsigc++ is licensed under the GNU Library General
