cat << EOF
Findlib is a library manager for Objective Caml.
It provides a convention how to store libraries,
and a file format ("META") to describe the properties
of libraries. There is also a tool (ocamlfind) for
interpreting the META files, so that it is very easy
to use libraries in programs and scripts.
