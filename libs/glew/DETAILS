cat << EOF
The goal of the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is to assist
C/C++ OpenGL developers with two tedious tasks: initializing and using
extensions and writing portable applications. GLEW provides an efficient
run-time mechanism to determine whether a certain extension is supported
by the driver or not. OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed
via a single header file. GLEW currently supports a variety of platforms
and operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Darwin, Irix, and Solaris.
