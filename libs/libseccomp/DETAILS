           SHORT="Enhanced seccomp library"

cat << EOF
The libseccomp library provides and easy to use, platform independent, interface
to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism: seccomp. The libseccomp API
is designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based syscall filter language
and present a more conventional function-call based filtering interface that
should be familiar to, and easily adopted by application developers.
