cat << EOF
The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5, with
just a few differences. The current implementation corresponds to Perl
5.8. PCRE was originally written for the Exim MTA, but is now used by many
projects including Python, Apache, Postfix, KDE, Analog, PHP, and Ferite.
