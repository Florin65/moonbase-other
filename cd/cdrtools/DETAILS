cdrtools, formerly Cdrecord creates home-burned CDs with a CD-R/CD-RW
recorder. It works as a burn engine for several applications. Cdrecord
supports CD recorders from many different vendors; all SCSI-3/mmc and
ATAPI/mmc compliant drives should also work. Supported features include
IDE/ATAPI, parallel-port, and SCSI drives, audio CDs, data CDs, and
mixed CDs, full multi-session support, CD-RWs (rewritable), TAO, DAO and
human-readable error messages. Cdrecord includes remote SCSI support and
can access local or remote CD-writers.
