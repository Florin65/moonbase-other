Cdparanoia is a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) extraction tool, commonly
known on the net as a 'ripper'.  Cdparanoia will read correct, rock-solid
audio data from inexpensive drives prone to misalignment, frame jitter and
loss of streaming during atomic reads. Cdparanoia will also read and repair
data from CDs that have been damaged in some way.
