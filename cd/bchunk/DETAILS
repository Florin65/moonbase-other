This is a Unix/C rewrite of the fine BinChunker software for some non-Unix
system. The non-Unix version of BinChunker has been obsoleted by
FireBurner, which can be found at www.fireburner.com. FireBurner does a
lot more than BinChunker did, but can be used to do exactly the same even
without a burner device installed. Thanks go to Bob Marietta , the author
of BinChunker, for the extensive help, documentation and letting me look
at his Pascal/Delphi source code!
