itrace helps to trace the creation of new files by a particular process. 
It is very useful if you want to trace where a "make install" put new 
files. It can make two kind of logs. The first type of log only lists 
the new files created by the process, while the second type includes 
such information as the chmod and chown operations made on the files. 
itrace was inspired by the installwatch and checkinstall programs.
