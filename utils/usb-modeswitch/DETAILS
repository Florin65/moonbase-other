USB_ModeSwitch is (surprise!) a mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop"
(multiple device) USB gear.

More and more USB devices (especially high-speed WAN stuff, based on cell phone
chipsets containing that feature) have their MS Windows drivers onboard; when
plugged in for the first time they act like a flash storage and start installing
the driver from there. After installation (and on every consecutive plugging)
the driver switches the mode internally, the storage device vanishes (in most
cases), and a new device (like an USB modem) shows up. Modem maker "Option"
calls that feature "ZeroCD (TM)" since it eliminates the need for shipping a
separate driver carrier.

USB_ModeSwitch makes this process easy to handle by taking the important
parameters from a configuration file and doing all the initialization and
communication stuff, with heavy help from "libusb".

It is mainly used automatically - via udev events and rules - to do the switch
without any user interaction. 
But it can also be run as a command line tool, usually when trying to make
unknown devices work with it.
