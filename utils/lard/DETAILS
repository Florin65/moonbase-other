           SHORT="Lard is a Logging and Rotation Daemon"

cat << EOF
Lard is a Logging and Rotation Daemon, that can replace the
functionality of sysklogd and logrotate together.

Logging is done almost exaclty the same as syslogd, with
added features such as regex matching, command triggers.
Rotation can be triggered while the daemon is running safely
by sending it a simple signal.
