txt2html is a Perl program that converts plain text to HTML.
It supports headings, lists, simple character markup, and hyperlinking, and is highly customizable.
It recognizes some of the apparent structure of the source document (mostly whitespace and typographic layout), and attempts to mark that structure explicitly using HTML.
