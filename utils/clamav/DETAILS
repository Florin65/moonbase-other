cat <<EOF
Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit written from scratch. It is licensed
under GNU GPL2 and uses the virus database from OpenAntiVirus, which is an
another free anti-virus project. In contrast to OpenAntiVirus (which is
written in Java), Clam AntiVirus is written entirely in C and its database is
KEPT UP TO DATE. It also detects polymorphic viruses as well.
