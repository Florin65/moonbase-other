GpsDrive displays your position provided from your NMEA capable GPS receiver on
a zoomable map, the map file is autoselected depending of the position and 
prefered scale. Speech output is supported if the "festival" software is 
running. The maps are autoselected for best resolution depending of your 
position and can be downloaded from Internet. All Garmin GPS reveiver with a 
serial output should be usable, also other GPS receiver which supports NMEA 
protocol.
