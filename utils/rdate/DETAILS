The rdate utility retrieves the date and time from another machine on
your network, using the protocol described in RFC 868.  If you run
rdate as root, it will set your machine's local time to the time of
the machine that you queried.  Note that rdate isn't scrupulously
accurate.  If you are worried about milliseconds, install the xntp3
package, which includes the xntpd daemon, instead.
