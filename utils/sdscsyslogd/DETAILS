# Long Description
cat << EOF
The SDSC Secure Syslog (also known as High Performance Syslog) is a project to build a next-generation system audit and logging facility.

The goal is to build a system logging facility that addresses these problems: 

high volume of system logs at medium and large sites (such as e-commerce sites or ISPs) can easily overwhelm "classic" syslog and its UDP transport mechanism;

 
this encourages sites to either not create some logs or to frequently roll them over and discard old log messages; 

which makes it difficult to conduct investigations of computer-related crime and related incidents.
