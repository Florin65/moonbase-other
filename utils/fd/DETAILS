cat << EOF
While it does not seek to mirror all of find's powerful functionality, it
provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.
Features:
  Convenient syntax: fd PATTERN instead of find -iname '*PATTERN*'.
  Colorized terminal output (similar to ls).
  It's fast.
  Smart case: the search is case-insensitive by default.
  It switches to case-sensitive if the pattern contains an uppercase character.
  Ignores hidden directories and files, by default.
  Ignores patterns from your .gitignore, by default.
  Regular expressions.
  Unicode-awareness.
  The command name is 50% shorter* than find :-).
  Parallel command execution with a syntax similar to GNU Parallel.
