The Event Notify Test Runner is a general purpose Unix utility intended to make
rapid feedback and automated testing natural and completely ordinary. entr is
a zero-configuration tool with no external build or runtime dependencies.
The interface to entr is not only minimal, it aims to be simple enough to create
a new category of ad hoc automation.
These micro-tests reduce keystrokes, but more importantly they emphasize the
utility of automated checks.
