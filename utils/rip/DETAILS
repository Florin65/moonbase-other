cat << EOF
rip is a command-line deletion tool focused on safety, ergonomics, and
performance. It favors a simple interface, and does not implement the xdg-
trash spec or attempt to achieve the same goals.
Deleted files get sent to the graveyard (/tmp/graveyard-$USER by default,
giving you a chance to recover them. No data is overwritten. If files that
share the same path are deleted, they will be renamed as numbered backups.
