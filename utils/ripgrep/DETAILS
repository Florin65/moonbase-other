cat << EOF
ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect your .gitignore
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. ripgrep is
similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.
