The icoutils are a set of command-line programs for extracting and converting images in 
Microsoft Windows icon and cursor files. These files usually have the extension .ico or
.cur, but they can also be embedded in executables and libraries (.dll-files).

The icotool program converts icon and cursor files into a set of PNG images. (Each icon/cursor
file may contain multiple images, usually of different sizes and with different number of colors.)
Icotool can also create icon/cursor files from PNG images.

The wrestool program can extract both icons and cursors from 32-bit ("PE") and 16-bit ("NE")
executables and libraries. It writes .ico and .cur files that can be used on Windows operating
systems as well. Other types of embedded resourced can be extracted, however only in raw form - icons
and cursors require additional conversion before they can be saved as icon and cursor files.

The extresso script automates the tasks of extracting and converting icons. This is done with the
help of of special resource scripts. The purpose of these scripts are to give names to the icons
in the executables and libraries.
