Discover is a set of libraries and utilities for gathering and
reporting information about a system's hardware. It uses OS-specific
modules to detect the hardware present on the system, and provides
a system-independent interface for querying XML data sources about
this hardware.

Discover can be used by linking against its C libraries or by invoking
the "discover" command. Other interfaces may follow in the future for
languages such as Perl and Python.
