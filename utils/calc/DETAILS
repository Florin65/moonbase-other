Calc is an interactive calculator which provides for easy large numeric
calculations, but which also can be easily programmed for difficult or long
calculations. It can accept a command line argument, in which case it executes
that single command and exits. Otherwise, it enters interactive mode. In this
mode, it accepts commands one at a time, processes them, and displays the
answers. Cals comes with a rich set of builtin mathematical and programmatic
functions. Try "help builtin" or "help overview" at the calc command prompt.
It's useful as a calculator, an algorithm prototyper, and as a mathematical
research tool. More importantly, calc provides a machine-independent means of
computation. Much more full-featured than BC.
