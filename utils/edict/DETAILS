Love the command line? Hate to switch to a browser to search the web for 
word meanings? Well, "edict" is the word you've been looking for.  Edict 
is a nifty li'l app (size 16k) which you can use as your dictionary. It 
will fit very well into your command line intensive job and it's faster 
than your browser too! Give it a try.
Edict can be used to view the meaning of English words. It can also 
provide related details like etymology, function, pronunciation etc. 
Adding support for other languages is not included, but is easy. Edict 
can grab the meaning of any word from the convenience of the command 
line. You can ask for meanings of multiple words at once. You can call 
edict from within your scripts.
