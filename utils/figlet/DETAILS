FIGlet prints its input using large characters (called  ``FIGcharacters'') made
up of ordinary screen characters (called ``sub-characters''). FIGlet output is
generally reminiscent of the sort of ``signatures'' many people like to put at
the end of e-mail and UseNet mes sages. It is also reminiscent of the output of
some banner programs, although it is oriented normally not sideways.
