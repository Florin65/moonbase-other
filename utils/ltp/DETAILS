The Linux Test Project is a joint project with SGI, IBM, OSDL, Bull,
and Wipro Technologies with a goal to deliver test suites to the
open source community that validate the reliability, robustness,
and stability of Linux. The Linux Test Project is a collection of
tools for testing the Linux kernel and related features. Our goal is
to improve the Linux kernel by bringing test automation to the kernel
testing effort. Interested open source contributors are encouraged to
join the project.
