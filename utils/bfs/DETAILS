           SHORT="A breadth-first version of the UNIX find command"

cat << EOF
bfs is a variant of the UNIX find command that operates breadth-first rather
than depth-first. It is otherwise intended to be compatible with many versions
of find (POSIX, GNU, *BSD).
bfs tries to be easier to use than find, while remaining compatible.
For example, bfs is less picky about where you put its arguments.
