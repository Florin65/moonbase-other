cat << EOF
psutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for
retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU,
memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python. It is useful mainly for system
monitoring, profiling and limiting process resources and management of running
processes. It implements many functionalities offered by classic UNIX command
line tools such as ps, top, iotop, lsof, netstat, ifconfig, free and others.
