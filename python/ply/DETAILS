PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python.
In a nutshell, PLY is nothing more than a straightforward lex/yacc implementation.
Here is a list of its essential features:
 - It's implemented entirely in Python.
 - It uses LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and well suited for larger
   grammars.
 - PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for
   empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for
   ambiguous grammars.
 - PLY is straightforward to use and provides very extensive error checking.
 - PLY doesn't try to do anything more or less than provide the basic lex/yacc
   functionality.
In other words, it's not a large parsing framework or a component of some
larger system.
