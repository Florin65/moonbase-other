cat << EOF
numpy contains:
    * a powerful N-dimensional array object
    * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    * basic linear algebra functions
    * basic Fourier transforms
    * sophisticated random number capabilities
    * tools for integrating Fortran code.

NumPy derives from the old Numeric code base and can be used as a replacement
for Numeric. It also adds the features introduced by Numarray and can also be
used to replace Numarray.
