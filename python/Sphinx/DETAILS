cat << EOF
Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of
multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl. It was
originally created for the new Python documentation, and has excellent
facilities for Python project documentation, but C/C++ is supported as
well, and more languages are planned.
