cat << EOF
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language. It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax, and isn't
difficult to learn. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level
data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system
calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (Tk, Mac,
MFC, GTK+, Qt, wxWindows). Newbuilt-in modules are easily written in C
or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for applications
that need a programmable interface.
