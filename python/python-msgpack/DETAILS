           SHORT="An efficient binary serialization format"

cat << EOF
MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange
data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small
integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only
one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.
