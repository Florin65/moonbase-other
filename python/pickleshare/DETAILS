cat << EOF
PickleShare - a small ‘shelve’ like datastore with concurrency support.
Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary.
Unlike shelve, many processes can access the database simultaneously.
Changing a value in database is immediately visible to other processes
accessing the same database. Concurrency is possible because the values
are stored in separate files. Hence the “database” is a directory
where all files are governed by PickleShare.
