cat << EOF
setuptools is a collection of enhancements to the Python distutils
that allow you to more easily build and distribute Python packages,
especially ones that have dependencies on other packages.

Packages built and distributed using setuptools look to the user like
ordinary Python packages based on the distutils. Your users don't
need to install or even know about setuptools in order to use them,
and you don't have to include the entire setuptools package in your
distributions. By including just a single bootstrap module (an 8K .py
file), your package will automatically download and install setuptools
if the user is building your package from source and doesn't have a
suitable version already installed.
