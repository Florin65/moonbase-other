cat << EOF
Pexpect allows easy control of interactive console applications.
Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications;
controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their output.
Pexpect works like Don Libesâ€™ Expect. Pexpect allows your script to spawn
a child application and control it as if a human were typing commands.
