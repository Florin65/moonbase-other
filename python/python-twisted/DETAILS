cat << EOF
Twisted is a framework, written in Python, for writing networked applications.
It includes implementations of a number of commonly used network services such
as a web server, an IRC chat server, a mail server, a relational database
interface and an object broker.

Developers can build applications using all of these services as well as custom
services that they write themselves. Twisted also includes a user authentication
system that controls access to services and provides services with user context
information to implement their own security models.
