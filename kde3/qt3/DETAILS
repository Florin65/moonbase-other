Qt is a C++ toolkit for application development. It lets application 
developers target all major operating systems with a single application 
source code.

Qt provides a platform-independent API to all central platform 
functionality: GUI, database access, networking, file handling, etc. The 
Qt library encapsulates the different APIs of different operating systems, 
providing the application programmer with a single, common API for all 
operating systems. The native C APIs are encapsulated in a set of 
well-designed, fully object-oriented C++ classes. 

Certain envrionment variables must be defined before compiling and using 
applications that depend on qt3.
QTDIR=/opt/lunar/qt/3
PATH=/opt/lunar/qt/3/bin:$PATH

The order of the PATH variable is important if qt3 and qt2 both exist on the 
same machine.
