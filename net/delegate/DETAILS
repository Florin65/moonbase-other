cat << EOF
DeleGate is a multi-purpose application level gateway, or a proxy server 
which runs on multiple platforms (Unix, Windows, Mac OS X, and OS/2). 
DeleGate mediates communication of various protocols (HTTP, FTP, NNTP, 
SMTP, POP, Telnet, SOCKS, etc.), applying cache and conversion for 
mediated data, controlling access from clients and routing toward 
servers. It translates protocols between clients and servers, applying 
SSL(TLS) to arbitrary protocols, merging several servers into a single 
server view with aliasing and filtering. Born as a tiny proxy for Gopher 
in March 1994, it has steadily grown into a general purpose proxy 
server. Besides proxy, DeleGate can be used as a simple origin server 
for some protocols (HTTP, FTP, and NNTP).
