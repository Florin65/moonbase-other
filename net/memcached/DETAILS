cat << EOF
memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system,
generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications
by alleviating database load.
It uses libevent to scale to any number of open connections (using epoll on
Linux, if available at runtime), uses non-blocking network I/O, refcounts
internal objects (so objects can be in multiple states to multiple clients), and
uses its own slab allocator and hash table so virtual memory never gets
externally fragmented and allocations are guaranteed O(1).
