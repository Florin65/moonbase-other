cat << EOF
Wireshark is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. It allows
you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file on disk. You can
interactively browse the capture data, viewing summary and detail information
for each packet. Wireshark has several powerful features, including a rich
display filter language and the ability to view the reconstructed stream of a
TCP session.
