 nslint is a lint-like program that checks DNS files for errors. DNS or Domain Name System generally maps names to IP addresses and E-mail addresses in a hierarchical fashion. Errors detected include missing trailing dots, illegal characters (RFC 1034), records without matching PTR records and vice-versa, duplicate names in a subnet, duplicate names for an address, names with cname records (RFC 1033), missing quotes, and unknown keywords.
