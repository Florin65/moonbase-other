# description: This is a daemon which runs on Howl clients to monitor the \
#              state of a network interface.  nifd must be running on systems \
#              that use autoipd and mDNSResponder to automatically obtain a  \
#              Link-Local IPv4 address and do Zeroconf service discovery. \
#              nifd should not be running otherwise.
