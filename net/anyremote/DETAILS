cat << EOF
The overall goal of this project is to provide remote control service on Linux
through Bluetooth, InfraRed, Wi-Fi or just TCP/IP connection. anyRemote supports
wide range of modern cell phones like Nokia, SonyEricsson, Motorola and others.

It was developed as thin communication layer between Bluetooth (or IR, Wi-Fi)
capabled phone and Linux, and in principle could be configured to manage almost
any software.

anyRemote is console application, but in addition there are GUI front ends for
Gnome and KDE.
