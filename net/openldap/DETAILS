The OpenLDAP Project is a collaborative effort to provide a robust, commercial-
grade, fully featured, open source LDAP software suite. The project is managed
by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to communicate,
plan, and develop OpenLDAP Software and its related documentation.
OpenLDAP Software provides a complete LDAP implementation including server,
clients, C SDK, and associated tools.
