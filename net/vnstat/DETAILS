cat << EOF
vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor for Linux and BSD that keeps
a log of network traffic for the selected interface(s).
It uses the network interface statistics provided by the kernel as information
source. This means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also
ensures light use of system resources.
