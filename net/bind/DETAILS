BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the Domain Name
System (DNS) protocols and provides an openly redistributable reference
implementation of the major components of the Domain Name System, including:
    * a Domain Name System server (named)
    * a Domain Name System resolver library
    * tools for verifying the proper operation of the DNS server
The BIND DNS Server is used on the vast majority of name serving machines on
the Internet, providing a robust and stable architecture on top of which an
organization's naming architecture can be built. The resolver library included
in the BIND distribution provides the standard APIs for translation between
domain names and Internet addresses and is intended to be linked with
applications requiring name service.
