cat << EOF
The ConnMan project provides a daemon for managing internet connections
within embedded devices running the Linux operating system. The
Connection Manager is designed to be slim and to use as few resources
as possible, so it can be easily integrated. It is a fully modular
system that can be extended, through plug-ins, to support all kinds
of wired or wireless technologies. Also, configuration methods, like
DHCP and domain name resolving, are implemented using plug-ins. The
plug-in approach allows for easy adaption and modification for various
use cases.
