cat << EOF
Nomad is a network mapping program designed to automatically discover a local network, using SNMP to identify network devices and work out how they are physically connected together. The network is then presented as a topology diagram with simple integrated monitoring. Changes in the network are reflected in the diagram which continuously updates, and you can customise your own views of the network map with various views and filters. At least that's what's supposed to happen. Nomad is released under the GNU General Public License.
