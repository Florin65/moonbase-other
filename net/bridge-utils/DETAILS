cat << EOF
A Linux bridge is more powerful than a pure hardware bridge because it
can also filter and shape traffic. A bridge transparently relays traffic
between multiple network interfaces. In plain English this means that
a bridge connects two or more physical Ethernets together to form one
bigger (logical) Ethernet.
