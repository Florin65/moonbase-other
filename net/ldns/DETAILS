           SHORT="Fast DNS library supporting recent RFCs"

cat << EOF
The goal of ldns is to simplify DNS programming, it supports recent RFCs
like the DNSSEC documents, and allows developers to easily create software
conforming to current RFCs, and experimental software for current Internet
Drafts. A secondary benefit of using ldns is speed; ldns is written in C it
should be a lot faster than Perl.
