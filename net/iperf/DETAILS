cat << EOF
While tools to measure network performance, such as ttcp, exist,
most are very old and have confusing options. Iperf was developed as
a modern alternative for measuring TCP and UDP bandwidth performance.

Iperf is a tool to measure maximum TCP bandwidth, allowing the tuning
of various parameters and UDP characteristics. Iperf reports bandwidth,
delay jitter, datagram loss.
