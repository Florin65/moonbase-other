From the author's website --

slurm started as a pppstatus port to FreeBSD. As I ripped off several functions
here is an overview of the features:

    * realtime traffic statistics divided into incoming and outgoing
    * optional combined view
    * can monitor any kind of network interface (testers welcome!)
    * shows detailed statistics about the interface.
    * it's themeable (since 0.3.0)
