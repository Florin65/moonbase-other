BW Whois is a whois client designed to work with the new "Shared
Registration System" whois introduced 1 December 1999. This new system
has proved to be remarkably disorga- nized and inconsistent, resulting
in tremendous confusion for those of us who need to find the ownership
of a domain now and then.
