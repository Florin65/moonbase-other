cat << EOF
bbswitch is a kernel module which automatically detects the required ACPI calls
for two kinds of Optimus laptops. It has been verified to work with "real"
Optimus and "legacy" Optimus laptops (at least, that is how I call them).
The machines on which these tests has performed are:
   Clevo B7130 - GT 425M ("real" Optimus, Lekensteyns laptop)
   Dell Vostro 3500 - GT 310M ("legacy" Optimus, Samsagax' laptop)
(note: there is no need to add more supported laptops here as the universal
calls should work for every laptop model supporting either Optimus calls).
It's preferred over manually hacking with the acpi_call module because it can
detect the correct handle preceding _DSM and has some built-in safeguards:
 - You're not allowed to disable a card if a driver (nouveau, nvidia) is loaded.
 - Before suspend, the card is automatically enabled. When resuming, it's
   disabled again if that was the case before suspending. Hibernation should'
   work, but it not tested.
Precautionary measure :
  - On some machines, turning off the card is permanent and the card does not
    reappear on subsequents reboots, which can result into the screen staying
    black all the time, including the BIOS screen. If it occurs, first try to
    shutdown, unplug power cord, remove battery, wait 30s, then put everything
    back in and boot. If it's not solved, then the solution is to reset the BIOS
    to factory settings. Before executing bbswitch for the first time, it is
    therefore recommended to take note of the full key sequence in the BIOS to
    do a reset.
