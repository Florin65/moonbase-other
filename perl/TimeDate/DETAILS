This distribution replaces my earlier GetDate distribution, which was
only a date parser. The date parser contained in this distribution is
far superior to the yacc based parser, and a *lot* fatser.

The parser contained here will only parse absolute dates, if you want a
date parser that can parse relative dates then take a look at the Time
modules by David Muir on CPAN.
