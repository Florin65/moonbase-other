cat << EOF
Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl
modules. It is meant to be an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing
in a much more straightforward way than with MakeMaker. It also does
not require a make on your system - most of the Module::Build code
is pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform way.
