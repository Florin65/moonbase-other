This module is an interface to libxml2, providing XML and HTML
parsers with DOM, SAX and XMLReader interfaces, a large subset of
DOM Layer 3 interface and a XML::XPath-like interface to XPath API
of libxml2. The module is split into several packages which are
not described in this section; unless stated otherwise, you only
need to use XML::LibXML; in your programs.
