This module is an interface to libxml2, providing XML and HTML parsers with
DOM, SAX and XMLReader interfaces, a large subset of DOM Layer 3 interface
and a XML::XPath-like interface to XPath API of libxml2. The module is split
into several packages which are not described in this section; unless stated
otherwise, you only need to use XML::LibXML; in your programs.
