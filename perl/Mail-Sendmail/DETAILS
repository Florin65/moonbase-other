Mail::Sendmail : A simple module to send mail.

Simple platform independent e-mail from your perl script. 
Only requires Perl 5 and a network connection. 

After struggling for some time with various command-line mailing
programs which never did exactly what I wanted, I put together 
this Perl only solution. 

Mail::Sendmail contains mainly &sendmail, which takes a hash with the
message to send and sends it. It is intended to be very easy to setup
and use.
