TekNap - *the* console napster/opennap client
TekNap is a console Napster client written and maintained by the author
of a very well known IRC client, BitchX -- Colten Edwards aka panasync.
Owing to the fact that it is based on BitchX, it shares the same script
writing abilities. It has built in support for both OpenNap and Napster
servers. The program has been ported to a variety of Operating Systems,
the list of these can be viewed in the section below.
