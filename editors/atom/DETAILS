Atom is a desktop application based on web technologies. Like other desktop apps,
it has its own icon in the dock, native menus and dialogs, and full access to the
file system.
Whether you're tweaking the look of Atom's interface with CSS or adding major
features with HTML and JavaScript, it's never been easier to take control of your
editor.
