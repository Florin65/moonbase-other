led is a small text editor

Led is more or less a rewrite; new features include multiple 
buffers, unlimited undo, better text killing commands, 
improved isearch and reverse searching, vertical and horizontal 
split screens, improved syntax highlighting, optional perl 
scriptability, and an extensible, stackable view architecture
