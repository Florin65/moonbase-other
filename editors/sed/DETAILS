sed - A stream-oriented non-interactive text editor
Takes text input, performs some operation (or set of operations) on it
and outputs the modified text. Sed is typically used for extracting part
of a file using pattern matching or substituting multiple occurences of
a string within a file.

NOTE: tchan downgraded back to sed-4.0.9 as sed-4.1 is severely broken in "sed -i".
Don't upgrade until the sed authors fix "sed -i", specifically the code
they use in execute.c does NOT set chown and chmod correctly!!!
