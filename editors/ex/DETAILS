cat << EOF
The vi editor is one of the most common text editors on Unix. It was 
developed starting around 1976 by Bill Joy at UCB, who was tired of 
the ed editor. Compared to most of its many clones, the original vi is 
a rather small program (~120 KB code on i386) just with its extremely
powerful editing interface, but lacking fancy features like multiple 
undo, multiple screens or syntax highlighting. In other words, it is a 
typical Unix program that does exactly what it should and nothing more.
