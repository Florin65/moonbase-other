cat << EOF
ht is a file editor/viewer/analyzer for executables.

Support means that HT will be able to correctly display and modify the 
executable header, image and other extensions specific to the file
(import/export sections, relocations, debugging information etc.). 
Support will probably include the following file formats:

  * Win32 portable executables (PE) (good support)
  * Unix executable and linkable format (ELF) (good support)
  * DOS standard executables (MZ) (supported)
  * Win32 linear executables (LE) (supported)
  * Windows/OS2 "new" executables (NE) (supported)
  * Unix common object file format (COFF) + DJGPP COFF (supported)
  * OS2 linear executables (LX)
  * M$ object files (.obj)
