joe is a free ASCII-Text Screen Editor for UNIX

joe has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences 
are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C. JOE is much more powerful 
than those editors, however. JOE has all of the features a UNIX 
user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent 
screen update optimizations, simple installation, and all of 
the UNIX-integration features of VI.
