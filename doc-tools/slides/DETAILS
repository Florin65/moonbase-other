The Slides Document Type is an XML vocabulary derived from DocBook. It
is used to create presentations (slides, foils, whatever you call
them) in HTML or print.
                                                                                                
Presentations are by nature visual and the Slides stylesheets provide
a wide range of options to control how the transformation from XML to
HTML is performed.

This document is a first attempt at describing what some of these
options are and how to use them.
