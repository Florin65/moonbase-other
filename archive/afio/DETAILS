           SHORT="A cpio-compatible archive/backup program"

cat << EOF
Afio makes cpio-format archives. It deals somewhat gracefully with input data
corruption, supports multi-volume archives during interactive operation, and
can make compressed archives that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio
archives. Afio is best used as an \`archive engine' in a backup script.
