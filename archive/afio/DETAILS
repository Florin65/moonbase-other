SHORT="A cpio-compatible archive/backup program."

cat << EOF

Afio makes cpio-format archives. It deals somewhat gracefully
with input data corruption, supports multi-volume archives
during interactive operation, and can make compressed archives
that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives. Afio
is best used as an \`archive engine' in a backup script.
