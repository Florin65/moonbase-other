cat << EOF
Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression
ratios. It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while
being backed by a very fast decoder. It also offers a special mode for small
data, called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any
sample set.
