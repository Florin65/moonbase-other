Psiconv is a file conversion utility that converts between Psion 5(MX) files 
and more commonly-used Linux file formats. It can read Psion Word, TextEd, 
Sketch, MBM, and Clipart files, and outputs HTML 3.2, HTML 4, ASCII, and almost 
any graphical format. The libpsiconv library can also read Sheet files and 
output Word and TextEd files for use in other programs. Included is full 
documentation on several Psion 5(MX) file formats. This information is not 
available from Psion (it has been reverse-engineered from Psion files), and 
it's free for anybody to use.
