cat << EOF
Raqm is a small library that encapsulates the logic for complex text layout and provides a convenient API.

It currently provides bidirectional text support (using FriBiDi), shaping (using HarfBuzz), and proper script itemization. As a result, Raqm can support most writing systems covered by Unicode.

The documentation can be accessed on the web at:

    http://host-oman.github.io/libraqm/

Raqm (Arabic: رَقْم) is writing, also number or digit and the Arabic word for digital (رَقَمِيّ) shares the same root, so it is a play on “digital writing”.
