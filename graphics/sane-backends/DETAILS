cat << EOF
SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application programming 
interface (API) that provides standardized access to any raster image scanner 
hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner, video- and still-cameras, 
frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE API is public domain and its discussion and 
development is open to everybody. The current source code is written for UNIX 
(including GNU/Linux) and is available under the GNU General Public License 
(the SANE API is available to proprietary applications and backends as well, 
however).
sane-backends is the collection of scanner interface libraries.
