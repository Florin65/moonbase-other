cat << EOF
OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible
3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for
developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics.
The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system
libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world
objects and other intuitive classes.
