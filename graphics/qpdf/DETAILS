QPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving transformations
on PDF files. It could have been called something like pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many
useful capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people who just want
to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more about how they work.

QPDF is capable of creating linearized (also known as web-optimized) files and encrypted
files. It is also capable of converting PDF files with object streams (also known as
compressed objects) to files with no compressed objects or to generate object streams
from files that don't have them (or even those that already do). QPDF also supports a
special mode designed to allow you to edit the content of PDF files in a text editor.
