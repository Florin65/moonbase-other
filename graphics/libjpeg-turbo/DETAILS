cat << EOF
ibjpeg-turbo is a high-speed version of libjpeg for x86 and x86-64
processors which uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, etc.) to accelerate
baseline JPEG compression and decompression. libjpeg-turbo is generally
2-4x as fast as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all else being
equal.

libjpeg-turbo was originally based on libjpeg/SIMD by Miyasaka Masaru,
but the TigerVNC and VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to
the codec, including improved support for Mac OS X, 64-bit support,
support for 32-bit and big endian pixel formats (RGBA, ABGR, etc.),
accelerated Huffman encoding/decoding, and various bug fixes. The
goal was to produce a fully open source codec that could replace the
partially closed source TurboJPEG/IPP codec used by VirtualGL and
TurboVNC. libjpeg-turbo generally achieves 80-120% of the performance
of TurboJPEG/IPP. It is faster in some areas but slower in others.
