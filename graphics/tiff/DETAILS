This software provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a
widely used format for storing image data. The latest version of the
TIFF specification is available on-line in several different formats, as
are a number of Technical Notes (TTN's).
Included in this software distribution is a library, libtiff, for
reading and writing TIFF, a small collection of tools for doing simple
manipulations of TIFF images on UNIX systems, and documentation on the
library and tools. A small assortment of TIFF-related software for UNIX
that has been contributed by others is also included.
The library, along with associated tool programs, should handle most of
your needs for reading and writing TIFF images on 32- and 64-bit
machines. This software can also be used on older 16-bit systems though
it may require some effort and you may need to leave out some of the
compression support.
