Inkscape seeks to become a full featured open source SVG editor. Derived 
from the highly popular Sodipodi codebase, Inkscape strives to build 
full XML, SVG, and CSS2 compliance, convert the codebase from C/Gtk to 
C++/Gtkmm, emphasizes a lightweight core with powerful features added 
through an extension mechanism, and promotes friendly, open, 
community-oriented development processes.
