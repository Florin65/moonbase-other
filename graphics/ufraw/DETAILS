The Unidentified Flying Raw (UFRaw) is a utility to read and manipulate raw
images from digital cameras. It can be used on its own or as a Gimp plug-in.
It reads raw images using Dave Coffin's raw conversion utility - DCRaw. UFRaw
supports basic color management using Little CMS, allowing the user to apply
color profiles. For Nikon users UFRaw has the advantage that it can read the
camera's tone curves. Even if you don't own a Nikon, you can still apply a
Nikon curve to your images.
