cat << EOF
Set of utilites built upon sysfs, a new virtual filesystem in Linux kernel versions 2.5+ that exposes a system's device tree. The current version of sysfsutils includes the following:
* libsysfs - The library's purpose is to provide a consistant and stable interface for querying system device information exposed through sysfs.
* systool - A utility built upon libsysfs that lists devices by bus, class, and topology.
* A number of utilities that demonstrate API usage in the "test" directory of the source tarball.
* A comprehensive testsuite.
