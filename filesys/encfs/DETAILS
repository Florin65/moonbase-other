cat << EOF
EncFS provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space. EncFS runs
without any special permissions and uses the FUSE library and Linux
kernel module to provide the filesystem interface. You can find links
to source and binary releases below.
As with most encrypted filesystems, Encfs is meant to provide security
against off-line attacks; ie your notebook is stolen, your backups
are stolen, etc. The way Encfs works is different from the loopback
encrypted filesystem support built into the Linux kernel because it
works on files at a time, not an entire block device.
