cat << EOF
ZFS is an advanced file system and volume manager which was originally
developed for Solaris. It has been successfully ported to FreeBSD and
now there is a functional Linux ZFS kernel port too. The port currently
includes a fully functional and stable SPA, DMU, and ZVOL with a ZFS
Posix Layer (ZPL) on the way.
