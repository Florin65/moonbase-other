cat << EOF
arch is an amazingly cool revision control system, publicly distributed
under the terms of the GNU General Public License. arch features distributed
repositories, whole-tree patch sets, extensive logging, support for renames,
the ability to access archived revisions using ordinary programming tools
(e.g. diff -r or find and grep), excellent support for developing on
branches, and easy integration into automated software engineering
processes. Early adopters of arch have reported that they find it to have a
natural design, especially well integrated with standard unix development
environments. arch is self hosting with its author and some of the volunteer
contributors each maintaining their own repositories.
