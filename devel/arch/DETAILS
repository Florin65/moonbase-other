cat << EOF
arch is an amazingly cool revision control system, publicly distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. arch features distributed repositories, whole-tree patch sets, extensive logging, support for renames, the ability to access archived revisions using ordinary programming tools (e.g. diff -r or find and grep), excellent support for developing on branches, and easy integration into automated software engineering processes. Early adopters of arch have reported that they find it to have a natural design, especially well integrated with standard unix development environments. arch is self hosting with its author and some of the volunteer contributors each maintaining their own repositories.
