Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database is
a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value.
Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and
character string can be used as a key and a value.
Each key must be unique within a database. There is neither concept of data
tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.
Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast.
