Subversion is meant to be a better CVS, so it will have most of CVS's
features, with as many as possible in the 1.0 release. The main exception
is "svn blame" (i.e., "cvs annotate"), which has been put off until
after 1.0 for scheduling reasons. Generally, Subversion's interface to
a particular feature is similar to CVS's, except where there's a
compelling reason to do otherwise.
