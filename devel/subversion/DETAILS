Subversion is a free/open-source version control system. That is, Subversion
manages files and directories over time. A tree of files is placed into a
central repository. The repository is much like an ordinary file server, except
that it remembers every change ever made to your files and directories.
This allows you to recover older versions of your data, or examine the history
of how your data changed. In this regard, many people think of a version control
system as a sort of time machine.
