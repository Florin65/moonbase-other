REXML is an XML 1.0 compliant, reasonably fast, non-validating XML parser. It has an API that is designed to be intuitive, straightforward. and terse. REXML includes a tree model parser, a SAX2 streaming parser, and a pull parser. It also includes a full XPath implementation. All of REXML's parsers pass 100% of the Oasis XML non-validating tests.
