Welcome to CMake, the cross-platform, open-source make system. CMake is used to
control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler
independent configuration files. CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces
that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. CMake is quite
sophisticated: it is possible to support complex environments requiring system
configuration, pre-processor generation, code generation, and template
instantiation.
