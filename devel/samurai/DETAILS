cat << EOF
samurai is a ninja-compatible build tool written in C99 with a focus on
simplicity, speed, and portability.
samurai implements the ninja build language through version 1.9.0 except for
MSVC dependency handling (deps = msvc). It uses the same format for .ninja_log
and .ninja_deps as ninja, currently version 5 and 4 respectively.
It is feature-complete and supports most of the same options as ninja.
