cat << EOF
Grantlee is a plugin based String Template system written using the Qt framework.
The goals of the project are to make it easier for application developers to
separate the structure of documents from the data they contain, opening the door
for theming.

The syntax is intended to follow the syntax of the Django template system, and
the design of Django is reused in Grantlee. Django is covered by a BSD style license.
