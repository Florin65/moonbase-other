           SHORT="SIP is a tool to create Python bindings for C++ libraries."

cat << EOF
SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for C++ 
libraries. It was originally developed to create PyQt, the Python bindings for 
the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for any C++ library. 

SIP comprises a code generator and a Python module. The code generator 
processes a set of specification files and generates C++ code which is then 
compiled to create the bindings extension module. The SIP Python module 
provides support functions to the automatically generated code.
