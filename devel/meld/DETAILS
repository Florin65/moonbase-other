Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. It integrates especially well
with CVS. The diff viewer lets you edit files in place (diffs update
dynamically), and a middle column shows detailed changes and allows
merges. The margins show location of changes for easy navigation, and
it also features a tabbed interface that allows you to open many diffs
at once.
