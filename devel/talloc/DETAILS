           SHORT="A hierarchical, reference counted memory pool system with destructors"

cat << EOF
talloc is a small wrapper around malloc that makes memory hierarchical. It is
similar to a standard memory pool system, but much more powerful as any pointer
returned by talloc is also a pool. This allows you to hang structures off other
structures in an intuitive fashion, and free up a whole subtree of memory with
one call. talloc also features type safety, destructors, and many helper
functions.
