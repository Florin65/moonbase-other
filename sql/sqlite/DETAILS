cat << EOF
SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large subset
of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a single disk file.
The API is designed for convenience and ease of use. Applications that link
against SQLite can enjoy the power and flexiblity of an SQL database without
the administrative hassles of supporting a separate database server. Because
it omits the client-server interaction overhead and writes directly to disk,
SQLite is also faster than the big database servers for most operations. In
addition to the C library, the SQLite distribution includes a command-line
tool for interacting with SQLite databases and SQLite bindings for Tcl/Tk.
