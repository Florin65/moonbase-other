Pan is a newsreader, loosely based on Agent and Gravity, which attempts
to be pleasant to use for new and advanced users alike. It has all the
typical features found in newsreaders, and also supports offline
reading, multiple connections, and a number of features for power users
and alt.binaries fans.
