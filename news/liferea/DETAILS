Liferea is a news aggregator for RSS/RDF feeds which also supports CDF channels,
Atom/Echo/PIE feeds and OCS or OPML directories. The problem with FeedReader:
for now it's only available for Windows.
There are some projects for GNU/Linux, but no solution for GTK/GNOME, which does
not require Python or Perl. Liferea tries to fill this gap. Liferea is an
abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader.
