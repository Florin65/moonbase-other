UnixCW is a package of UNIX-based programs that fit together to form a CW tutor program similar to CP222 by VU2ZAP.  The core of the package is cwlib, a general-purpose CW functions library. There are four programs in the package built around this library: a simple Morse code sounding program; a small random character generator; a curses-based Morse code tutor; and a Qt-based (X windows) Morse code tutor. The Qt-based tutor program offers send practice as well as receive. The package includes complete man pages.
