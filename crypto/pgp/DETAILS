PGPi is the international variant of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), 
a public key encryption program originally written by Phil Zimmermann 
in 1991. Later PGP versions have been developed and distributed by 
MIT, ViaCrypt, PGP Inc., and now Network Associates Inc. (NAI). 
PGP is the de-facto standard for email encryption today, with millions 
of users worldwide.

The international PGP versions differ slightly from the US versions, 
but otherwise they are completely interoperable.
