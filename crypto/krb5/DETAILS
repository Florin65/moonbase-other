Kerberos was created by MIT as a solution to network security problems.
The Kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can prove its
identity to a server (and vice versa) across an insecure network connection.
After a client and server has used Kerberos to prove their identity, they can
also encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy and data integrity
as they go about their business.
