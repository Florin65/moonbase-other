cat << EOF
LibreTLS is a port of libtls from LibreSSL to OpenSSL. libtls is “a new TLS
library, designed to make it easier to write foolproof applications”.
libtls provides an excellent new API, but LibreSSL can be difficult to install
on systems which already use OpenSSL. LibreTLS aims to make the libtls API more
easily and widely available.
