cat << EOF
GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG easier
for applications. It provides a High-Level Crypto API for encryption,
decryption, signing, signature verification and key management. Currently it
uses GnuPG as it's backend but the API isn't restricted to this engine; in fact
it is planned to add other backends to it.
