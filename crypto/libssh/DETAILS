cat << EOF
The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working SSH
implementation by the mean of a library. The complete control of the client is
made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs, transfer
files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs. With its
Secure FTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily, without
third-party programs others than libcrypto (from openssl).
