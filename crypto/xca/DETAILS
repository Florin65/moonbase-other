cat << EOF
This application is intended for creating and managing X.509
certificates, certificate requests, RSA, DSA and EC private
keys, Smartcards and CRLs. Everything that is needed for a CA is
implemented. All CAs can sign sub-CAs recursively. These certificate
chains are shown clearly. For an easy company-wide use there are
customiseable templates that can be used for certificate or request
generation. All crypto data is stored in an endian-agnostic file
format portable across operating systems.
