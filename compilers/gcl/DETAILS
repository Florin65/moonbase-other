        SHORT="GCL is a Common Lisp interpreter and compiler"

cat << EOF
GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Austin Kyoto Common Lisp) is a compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp. GCL is very portable and extremely efficient on a wide class of applications, and compares favorably in performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem--prover and symbolic algebra systems. GCL supports the CLtL1 specification.
