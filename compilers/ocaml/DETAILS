Objective Caml belongs to the ML family of programming languages and 
has been implemented at INRIA Rocquencourt within the ``Cristal project''
group. Since ML's inception in the late seventies, there has been a 
continuous line of research at INRIA devoted to implementations and 
improvements of ML. Objective Caml owes a lot to the original core ML 
language and to our first Caml implementation (1985-1990). A new byte-coded 
implementation called Caml Light was developed in the early nineties. The 
language Caml Light is still in use, especially for education. The language 
was renamed Objective Caml after the incorporation of a sophisticated module
 system and an object-oriented layer
