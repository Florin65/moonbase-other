Objective Caml belongs to the ML family of programming languages and has been
implemented at INRIA Rocquencourt within the ``Cristal project'' group. Since
ML's inception in the late seventies, there has been a continuous line of
research at INRIA devoted to implementations and improvements of ML. Objective
Caml owes a lot to the original core ML language and to our first Caml
implementation (1985-1990). A new byte-coded implementation called Caml Light
was developed in the early nineties. The language Caml Light is still in use,
especially for education. The language was renamed Objective Caml after the
incorporation of a sophisticated module system and an object-oriented layer.
