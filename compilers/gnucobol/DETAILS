GnuCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler. GnuCOBOL implements a
substantial part of the COBOL 85 and COBOL 2002 standards, as well as
many extensions of the existent COBOL compilers.

GnuCOBOL translates COBOL into C and compiles the translated code using
the native C compiler. You can build your COBOL programs on various
platforms, including Unix/Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows.

The compiler is licensed under GNU General Public License.
The run-time library is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License.
