cat << EOF
biTStream is a set of C headers allowing a simpler access to binary structures such as
specified by MPEG, DVB, IETF, SMPTE, IEEE, SCTE, etc.

biTStream vs. libdvbpsi
libdvbpsi converts binary structures to C structures. Lists are implemented with chained lists of C structures.

biTStream is lower level, and more efficient: fewer memory allocations, fewer memory copies.
It also features a better separation between layers and specifications.
liba52 is a free library for decoding ATSC A/52 streams. The A/52 standard is
used in a variety of applications, including digital television and DVD. It is
also known as AC-3.
