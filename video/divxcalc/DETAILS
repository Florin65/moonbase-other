cat << EOF
DivX Calculator was created simply for the purpose to give an 
average for the DivX :-) 4.x bitrate.
NOTE: DivX :-) 4.x is extremely difficult to calculate as the 
sizes of the video vary depending on the amount of movement 
and colors, so this gives an average. Your results may be higher 
or lower than the specified size!
