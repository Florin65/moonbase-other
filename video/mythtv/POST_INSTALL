Please run /usr/share/mythtv/setup to configure MythTV.  The 
database has been installed for you, but you may want to muck around 
with the permissions a bit.

After running /usr/share/mythtv/setup, you'll have to run 
mythfilldatabase to fill the database with program listings for all the 
video sources you defined in the setup program.

mythfilldatabase should theoretically be run daily, something most 
easily done from a cronjob.

Add the following to your personal crontab to accomplish this
(crontab -e) to fill the database at 2:00am daily:
00 02 * * * /bin/bash /usr/bin/mythfilldatabasecron
