pork is an ncurses-based AOL instant messenger client.  It uses the
OSCAR protocol to access AIM.  Pork features Perl scripting; an online
help system; the ability to configure nearly all aspects of the 
program's look-and-feel; and alias system; and a powerful key binding
system.  It also supports being logged in with more than one screen
name at the same time.
