cat << EOF
AutoProfile is an extension to Gaim that allows users to create 
customized away messages and profiles using dynamic "components" that
automatically update on a regular basis. Generated text can include 
song names from XMMS/Winamp/iTunes, fortune quotes, computer uptime, 
the contents of a Web page or a text file, the output of a program, 
and timestamps.

The plugin comes complete with a graphical preference system that 
covers a wide range of options and lets users choose exactly how they
want their profiles to behave. The code is Open Source (licensed under
the GPL) and designed such that it is extremely easy for users to 
extend the capabilities of this plugin.
