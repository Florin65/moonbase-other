SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which provides secure
conferencing services on the Internet over insecure channel. SILC superficially
resembles IRC, although they are very different internally. They both provide
conferencing services and have almost the same set of commands. Other than
that, they are nothing alike. The SILC is secure and the network model is
entirely different compared to IRC.
