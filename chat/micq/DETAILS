mICQ (Matt's ICQ Clone) is a portable, small, yet powerful console-based
ICQ client. It supports password changing, auto-away, creation of new accounts,
and other features that makes it a very complete yet simple client. It is able
to send and receive messages from the ICQ network, list users that are offline
and online (including their online status), search for users by email address,
and look up basic (name, UIN, email) information.
