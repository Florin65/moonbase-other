This is the stable version of the 2.6.x branch.

Lunar Linux is using the AS patchset by default since there is
no 2.6.x specific lunar patchset yet. AS is only bringing in
security fixes and important tweaks. It is not adding any new
features.

Linux is a clone of the Unix kernel, written from scratch by Linus
Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the
Net. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance. It
has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix
kernel, including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries,
demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory
management, and TCP/IP networking.
