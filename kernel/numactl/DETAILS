cat << EOF
NUMA stands for Non-Uniform Memory Access, in other words a system whose memory
is not all in one place. The system consists of multiple "nodes" of cpu's
(processors) and/or memory which are linked together by a special high-speed
network. All cpu's have access to all of memory, but a cpu's access to memory on
the local or a nearby node is faster than to distant nodes.
The numactl program allows you to run your application program on specific cpu's
and memory nodes. It does this by supplying a NUMA memory policy to the operating
system before running your program.
