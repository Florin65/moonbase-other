R is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was
developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now LucentiTechnologies) by John
Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of
S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs
unaltered under R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling,
classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering,
...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often
the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an
Open Source route to participation in that activity.
