ARPACK is a collection of Fortran77 subroutines
designed to solve large scale eigenvalue problems.

No single release has been published by Rice university
for the last few years and since many software (Octave,
Scilab, R, Matlab...) forked it and implemented their own
modifications, arpack-ng aims to tackle this by providing
a common repository and maintained versions.
