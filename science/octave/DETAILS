cat << EOF
Octave is a high-level interactive language, primarily intended
for numerical computations that is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
Octave can do arithmetic for real and complex scalars and matrices,
solve sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, integrate functions
over finite and infinite intervals, and integrate systems of ordinary
differential and differential-algebraic equations.
