Octave is a high-level interactive language, primarily intended for 
numerical computations that is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
Octave can do arithmetic for real and complex scalars and matrices, 
solve sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, integrate functions over 
finite and infinite intervals, and integrate systems of ordinary 
differential and differential-algebraic equations.
