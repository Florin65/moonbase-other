The GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) package is intended for solving
large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other
related problems. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and organized in
the form of a callable library.

GLPK supports the GNU MathProg language, which is a subset of the AMPL language.

The GLPK package includes the following main components:
Revised simplex method.
Primal-dual interior point method.
Branch-and-bound method.
Translator for GNU MathProg.
Application program interface (API).
Stand-alone LP/MIP solver.
