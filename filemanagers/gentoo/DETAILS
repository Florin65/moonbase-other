cat << EOF
gentoo is a modern, powerful, flexible, and utterly configurable file manager 
for UNIX systems, written using the GTK+ toolkit. It aims to be 100% 
graphically configurable; there's no need to edit config files by hand and 
then restart the application. gentoo is somewhat inspired in its look & feel 
by the classic Amiga program DirectoryOpus.
