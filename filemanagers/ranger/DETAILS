cat << EOF
ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings.
It provides a minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the
directory hierarchy. It ships with rifle, a file launcher that is good at
automatically finding out which program to use for what file type.

Optional it can use, if installed the following modules:
  elinks - for previews of html pages
  lynx - for previews of html pages
  w3m - for previews of images and html pages
  libcaca - for ASCII-art image previews
  odt2txt - for OpenDocument texts
  poppler - for pdf previews
  python-chardet - in case of encoding detection problems
  sudo - to use the "run as root"-feature
  transmission (cli) - for viewing bittorrent information

It can also use the following programs if installed (no modules for them right now) 
  atool - for previews of archives
  ffmpegthumbnailer - for video previews
  highlight - for syntax highlighting of code
  mediainfo - for viewing information about media files
  perl-image-exiftool - for viewing information about media files
