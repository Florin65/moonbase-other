cat << EOF
nnn is probably the fastest and most resource-sensitive (with all its
capabilities) file manager you have ever used.
It's extremely flexible too - integrates with your DE and favourite GUI
utilities, works with the desktop opener, supports bookmarks, has smart
navigation shortcuts, navigate-as-you-type mode, disk usage analyzer mode,
comprehensive file details and much more. nnn was initially forked from
noice but is significantly different today.
If you want to edit a file in vi with some soothing music in the background
while referring to a spec in your GUI PDF viewer, nnn got it! Quickstart and
see how nnn simplifies those long desktop sessions.
nnn supports as many scripts as you want to run! So you can integrate utilities
like sxiv (to view images in a directory) or fzy (to fuzzy find files in a
directory tree) easily.
