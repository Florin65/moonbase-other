cat << EOF
KBtin is a very heavily extended clone of well-known TinTin++.

The features include:
    * editing keys, input box
    * scrollback
    * status line
    * keybindings ("#bind F9 {do drop pasty from cloak,eat pasty}")
    * aliases, actions (triggers), substitutions, highlights
    * shortest-path graph traversing aliases ("mt>rh")
    * guaranteed actions (a line being split between two packets is not
      a problem)
    * lists processing ("#foreach {$friends} {tell $0 [XX] $message}")
    * TELNET protocol support
    * the ability to run local programs as it was a MUD -- this is the
      only client you can use with games like adventure, or even 
      programs like mysqlclient
    * secondary sessions (ICQ integration, etc)
