Epiar is a space adventure/combat game written in C with SDL (Simple
DirectMedia Layer) and OpenAL (Open Audio Library). It is absolutely
free (released under the General Public License v2).
In Epiar, you begin as a shuttle pilot in a galaxy generally ruled by
anarchy, with few stable governments and numerous rebel factions. You
start your adventure off doing whatever you want, but generally trying
to save up money for a new starship, and your adventure takes off from there ...
