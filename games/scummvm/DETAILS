  ScummVM is a collection of interpreters, capable of emulating several
  adventure game engines. ScummVM mainly supports engines created using 
  SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), used in various
  LucasArts games such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, and others.
  ScummVM also contains interpreters for several non-SCUMM games, currently
  these are Simon the Sorcerer (1 & 2), and Beneath a Steel Sky.
