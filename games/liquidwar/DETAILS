Liquid War is a unique multiplayer wargame. Its rules are truely original and 
have been invented by Thomas Colcombet. You control an army of liquid and have 
to try and eat your opponents. A single player mode is available, but the game 
is definitely designed to be multiplayer, and has network support.
