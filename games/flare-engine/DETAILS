cat <<EOF
Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine is a simple game engine built
to handle a very specific kind of game: single-player 2D action
RPGs. Flare is not a reimplementation of an existing game or engine. It
is a tribute to and exploration of the action RPG genre.

Rather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal
of this project is to build several real games and harvest an engine
from the common, reusable code. The first game, in progress, is a
fantasy dungeon crawl.
