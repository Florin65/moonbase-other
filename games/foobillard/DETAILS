FooBillard is an attempt to create a free OpenGL-billard for Linux.
FooBillard is still under development but the main physics is implemented. 
If you are a billard-pro and you're missing some physics,
please tell me. Cause I've implemented it like I think it should work,
which might differ from reality.
