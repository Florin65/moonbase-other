cat << EOF
Freeciv is a multiuser reimplementation for Unix/X of the famous Microprose game
of Civilization. By default, the game is an improved Civ II, but this can be
customized; modpacks for near-100% compatibility with Civ I and Civ II are
included. Multiuser gameplay is real-time: in each turn, all human players move
concurrently.
The game is designed to remain fairly playable even on poor network connections.
Freeciv can also be played on standalone machines, and its AI players are a good
challenge for beginners. The source code comes with the server, two X clients,
and non-X clients for MS Windows and Amiga.
