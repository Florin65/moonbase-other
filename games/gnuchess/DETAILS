GNU Chess lets most modern computers play a full game of chess. It has a plain
terminal interface but supports visual interfaces such as X-Windows "xboard" as
well as a full 3-dimensional wooden chess-board protocol for the Novag Chess
board enabling one to be relatively free of the computer itself. See the
distribution README for explanation.
