GNU Chess lets most modern computers play a full game of chess. It has a plain terminal interface but supports visual interfaces such as X-Windows "xboard" as well as a full 3-dimensional wooden chess-board protocol for the Novag Chess board enabling one to be relatively free of the computer itself. See the distribution README for explanation.
