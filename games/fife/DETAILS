FIFE stands for Flexible Isometric Free Engine and is a cross platform
game creation framework. It provides you with the ability to create
a game using Python interfaces. This means you need to have little to
no knowledge of C++ to make a game! Don't want to use Python? That's
okay because FIFE also comes as a DLL or static library so you can
also use C++!  We tried to make FIFE as flexible as possible so it
is not tied to any genre in specific. You can make just about any
2D game with FIFE but it is more geared toward a RTS or RPG in just
about any view style (isometric or top-down).
