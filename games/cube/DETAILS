This module will build an optimized client and server, one that won't work
together with the official binaries.

Landscape-style engine that pretends to be an indoor first person shooter
engine. Combines very high precision dynamic occlusion culling with a
form of geometric mipmapping on the whole world for dynamic LOD for
configurable fps & graphic detail on most machines. Uses OpenGL & SDL.

Allows in-engine editing of geometry in full 3D (you fly around the map,
point / drag stuff to select it / modify it), which can even be done
with multiple people at once (a first!). Has simplistic but effective
fine grain vertex lighting that looks like lightmapping and can do dynamic
lights & shadows. Doesn't need any kind of map precompilation, even
lighting is done on the fly. Has very simplistic quad-tree world structure
that can do slopes (heightfields with caps) and slants, water, does decent
collision detection & physics, has client/server networking that goes a
long way in giving a lag-free game experience, and features a Doom/Quake-style
singleplayer and multiplayer game with some uncompromising brutal oldskool
gameplay.

Most of the engine design is targeted at reaching feature richness through
simplicity of structure and brute force, rather than finely tuned complexity.
