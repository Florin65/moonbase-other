Katoob is a light weight, multi lingual, BIDI-aware text editor based on
the Gtk+ 2 library. It supports opening and saving files in multiple
encodings. The main support was for Arabic language but more
languages are currently supported. It should run on most BSD
and POSIX compliant operating systems.
