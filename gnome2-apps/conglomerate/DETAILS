Conglomerate is a project to create a complete structured information 
authoring, management, archival, revision control and transformation 
system. Conglomerate uses XML semantics and powerful graphical editing, 
coupled with a centralised storage model and a flexible transformation 
language to create an environment which is easy to use, produces 
high-quality structured output, and lets the user target several output 
media with a single source document.
