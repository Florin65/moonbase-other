cat << EOF
Terminal is a modern terminal emulator for the Unix/Linux desktop -
primarly for the Xfce desktop environment. We developed it because
we saw the need for a lightweight and easy to use terminal emulator
in the Xfce desktop environment, that doesn't require the user to
install the GNOME plattform, but still provides a worth alternative
to the GNOME terminal emulator.
