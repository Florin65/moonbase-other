What is KSetiSaver?
The seti@home project offers two different types of clients: A client with a graphical GUI and a pure command line client.
Unfortunately for Linux there's only a command client available. The command line client is quite fast compared to the Windows GUI version, but in my opinion WU crunching is much more fun when you can look on some cool graphics from time to time to really "see" what you are doing. Ok, this is the point where KSetiSaver kicks in: It acts as a normal screensaver for KDE. When it is launched it starts monitoring a seti@home client.
KSetiSaver is also able to launch setiathome. That means seti@home is only active, when the screensaver is. This way you get the same behaviour like you would with the Windows GUI client!
