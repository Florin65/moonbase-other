BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of
the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The
utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their
full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for
any small or embedded system.
