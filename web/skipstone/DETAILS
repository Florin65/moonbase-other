SkipStone is a Gtk+ Web Browser that embeds Mozilla's 
rendering component Gecko. It aims to be light and 
fast with few dependencies.

SkipStone is currently under heavy development, but 
its progressing quickly and coming along nicely. It 
provides a nice and simple configurable interface, 
bookmarks and all of the other mandantory browsing features.

Downloading is handled by SkipDownload by default, 
a Gtk+ frontend to the famous web downloading utility 
wget. However, if you prefer to use other download 
utilities / managers, this option is configurable.

Mail and external url handlers are also handled by 
external applications which can be configured to the users 
choice, leaving SkipStone to do what it does best - browsing.
