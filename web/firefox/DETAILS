Mozilla Firefox is the successor of Mozilla Firebird.

Firefox includes
  comprehensive popup controls to keep unwanted advertising off your desktop;
  a tab browsing mode that lets you open several pages in a single window,
    allowing you to load links in the background without leaving the page you're on;
  integrated Google search ;
  industry leading accessibility with Find As You Type - find links and pagei
    text by simply typing;
  simplified privacy controls that let you cover your tracks more effectively;
  a streamlined browser window that lets you see more of the page than any
    other browser while at the same time being more configurable;
  a large variety of free downloadable extensions and themes that add specific
    functionality and visual changes to the browser;

NOTE: This Lunar version of Firefox has crypto enabled and is gtk+-2.  NOTHING
ELSE IS CONFIGURED IN !!! (i.e NO mail, irc, composer, gpg, calendar, MathML, 
Javascript debugger, html code inspector, LDAP, help support.  If you
want any of that use the regular mozilla module.
