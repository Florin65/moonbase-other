A SOAP implementation for Python
SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a 
decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that 
consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for 
describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding 
rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes, and a 
convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses. SOAP 
can potentially be used in combination with a variety of other 
protocols; however, the only bindings defined in this document describe 
how to use SOAP in combination with HTTP and HTTP Extension Framework.
