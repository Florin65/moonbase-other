cat << EOF
Usermin is a web interface that can be used by any user on a Unix system 
to easily perform tasks like reading mail, setting up SSH or configuring 
mail forwarding. It can be thought of as a simplified version of Webmin 
designed for use by normal users rather than system administrators. 
Like Webmin, Usermin consists of a simple web server, and a number of 
CGI programs which directly update user config files like ~/.cshrc and 
~/.forward. The web server and all CGI programs are written in Perl 
version 5, and use only the non-standard Authen::PAM perl module.
