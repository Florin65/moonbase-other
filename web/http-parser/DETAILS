           SHORT="Parser for HTTP Request/Response written in C"

cat << EOF
This is a parser for HTTP messages written in C.
It parses both requests and responses. The parser is designed to be used
in performance HTTP applications. It does not make any syscalls nor
allocations, it does not buffer data, it can be interrupted at anytime.
Depending on your architecture, it only requires about 40 bytes of data
per message stream (in a web server that is per connection).

Features:
  No dependencies
  Handles persistent streams (keep-alive).
  Decodes chunked encoding.
  Upgrade support
  Defends against buffer overflow attacks.

The parser extracts the following information from HTTP messages:
  Header fields and values
  Content-Length
  Request method
  Response status code
  Transfer-Encoding
  HTTP version
  Request URL
  Message body
EOF
