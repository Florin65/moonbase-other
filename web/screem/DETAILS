 Screem is a website development environment. Its purpose is to increase 
productivity when constructing a web site by providing quick access to 
commonly used features of web sites (such as tables). It is written for use 
with the GNOME  desktop environment.  Unlike most other website/html
editors screem does not provide a WYSIWYG display of the page, but instead 
just gives you the raw html source code in its editor window.
