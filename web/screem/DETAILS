 Screem is a website development environment. Its purpose is to increase productivity when constructing a web site by providing quick access to commonly used features of web sites (such as tables). It is written for use with the GNOME  desktop environment

 Unlike most other website/html editors screem does not provide a WYSIWYG display of the page, but instead just gives you the raw html source code in its editor window. This enables you to type the HTML you want and also quickly add commonly used tags by using the features provided. The reasoning behind this is that WYSIWYG editors, in general, do not produce good valid html and also can slow you down if they do not support a tag that you wish to insert, therefore by just having the source shown to be edited you can type what you want when you want, but also have the ease of use of clicking a button to have the tag(s) you want inserted.
