Daq is the Data Acquisition library, for packet I/O. The DAQ replaces direct
calls to PCAP functions with an abstraction layer that facilitates operation
on a variety of hardware and software interfaces without requiring changes to
Snort. It is possible to select the DAQ type and mode when invoking Snort to
perform PCAP readback or inline operation, etc. The DAQ library may be useful
for other packet processing applications and the modular nature allows you to
build new modules for other platforms.
