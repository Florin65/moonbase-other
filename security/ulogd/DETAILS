ulogd is a replacement for traditional syslog-based logging (using the
LOG target) in iptables-based firewalls. ULOG/ulogd has a different
concept. Packets get copied to a special logging daemon, which can do
very detailed logging to different targets (plaintext files, MySQL
databases, ...). ulogd supports plugins for different output formats,
as well as for new protocols/...
