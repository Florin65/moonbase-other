cat << EOF
Snort is a lightweight network intrusion detection system, capable of 
performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks. It can 
perform protocol analysis, content searching/matching and can be used to detect 
a variety of attacks and probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, 
CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more. Snort uses 
a flexible rule based language to describe traffic that it should collect or 
pass, and a modular detection engine. Snort has a real-time alerting capability, 
with alert mechanisms for syslog, a user specified file, a UNIX socket, or 
WinPopup messages to Windows clients using Samba's smbclient.
