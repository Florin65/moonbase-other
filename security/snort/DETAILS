cat << EOF
Snort is a lightweight network intrusion detection system, capable of performing
real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks. It can perform
protocol analysis, content searching/matching and can be used to detect a
variety of attacks and probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans,CGI
attacks, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more. Snort uses a
flexible rule based language to describe traffic that it should collect or pass,
and a modular detection engine. Snort has a real-time alerting capability, with
alert mechanisms for syslog, a user specified file, a UNIX socket, or WinPopup
messages to Windows clients using Samba's smbclient.
