P0f v2 is a versatile passive OS fingerprinting tool. P0f can identify the system on:

   - machines that connect to your box (SYN mode),
   - machines you connect to (SYN+ACK mode),
   - machine you cannot connect to (RST+ mode),
   - machines that talk thru or near your box.

But checking the system is not all we can do, p0f will also check the following:

   - masquerading and firewall presence (useful for policy enforcement),
   - the distance to the remote system and its uptime,
   - other guy's network hookup (DSL, OC3, avian carriers) and his ISP.
