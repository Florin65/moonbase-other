cat << EOF
FAAD is the fastest ISO AAC audio decoder available. FAAD correctly decodes
all MPEG-4 and MPEG-2 MAIN, LOW, LTP, LD and ER object type AAC files.
There is a stable version of FAAD available, source code can be downloaded
on the download page. The advantage of this new library is the lack of
copyrighted code written by third parties. Further it is coded much cleaner
and will give a much better understanding of the AAC coding algorithms.
