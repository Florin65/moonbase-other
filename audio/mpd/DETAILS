Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, Ogg Vorbis,
FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists. MPD is designed for
integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control for music
playback over a local network. It also makes a great desktop music player,
especially if you are a console junkie, like frontend options, or restart X often.
