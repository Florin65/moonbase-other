GLAME (GNU/Linux Audio Mechanics) is meant to be the GIMP of audio
processing. It is designed to be a powerful, fast, stable, and easily
extensible sound editor for Linux and compatible systems. Supported
platforms are Linux, BSD, and IRIX. You need to have guile and libxml
installed to use GLAME, having GNOME libs available is highly
recommended.
