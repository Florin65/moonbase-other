Audioscrobbler is a computer system that builds up a detailed profile of 
your musical taste. After installing an Audioscrobbler Plugin, your 
computer sends the name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler 
Server.

With this information, the Audioscrobbler server builds you a 'Musical 
Profile'. Statistics from your Musical Profile are shown on your 
Audioscrobbler User Page, available for everyone to view.
