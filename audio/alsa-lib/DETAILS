From http://www.alsa-project.org/intro.php3
The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture project is being developed in the Linux
operating system and is released under version 2 of the GPL (GNU general
public license) and the LGPL (GNU library general public license).

Primary goals:
1. Create a fully modularized sound driver which supports kerneld and kmod.
2. Create the ALSA Kernel API which surpasses the current OSS API.
3. Maintain compatibility with most OSS/Lite binaries.
4. Create the ALSA Library (C, C++), which simplify ALSA application development.
5. Create the ALSA Manager, an interactive configuration program for the driver.
