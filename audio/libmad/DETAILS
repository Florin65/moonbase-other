From the mad home page:
MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports
MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2  extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies, as
well as the so-called MPEG 2.5 format. All three audio layers 
(Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented.
MAD has the following special features:

   * 24-bit PCM output
   * 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
   * completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards
   * distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)

Because MAD provides full 24-bit PCM output, applications using MAD
are able to produce high quality audio. Even when the output device
supports only 16-bit PCM, applications can use the extra resolution to
increase the audible dynamic range through the use of dithering or
noise shaping.
