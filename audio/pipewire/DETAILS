cat << EOF
PipeWire is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia pipelines. This includes:

    Making available sources of video (such as from a capture devices or application provided streams) and multiplexing this with clients.
    Accessing sources of video for consumption.
    Generating graphs for audio and video processing.

Nodes in the graph can be implemented as separate processes, communicating with sockets and exchanging multimedia content using fd passing.
